Have torpe Beauty. Grace\nand Intelligence, and Especially\nRadiance.\nWhat can a young girl, who Is net\nther a great beauty nor a great heir\ness, nor one to whom the gods stood\nsponsor at birth, do to make herself\npopular?\nLet us sit down and take our chins\nIn our hands and think about It\nA girl must have, at least In some\nsmall degree, four qualities. There\nare children of fortune who have them\nall, and in abundance, but as from a\nsmall palette of primary colors a great\npicture may be painted, just so out\nof a few elementary attributes quite\nwonderful results are possible. The\nfour qualities of personality are:\nBeauty, grace, intelligence, radk\nance.\nBeauty may be that of face or fig\nure, oAAt may be merely an effort of\nbeauty through style, charm, or even\none of the other three qualities fol\nlowing:\nGrace includes not alone symmetrj\nof movement, but all accomplish\nments In activity, such a a dancing,\nskating, swimming, riding, and also\nany especial gifts, such as a talent for\nmusic or acting. In other words, the\ngirl who has the \"gift of grace\u201d in the\ngirl who does things well.\nBy intelligence is meant the sympa\nthetic, adaptable quality of mind, rath\ner than that of the brilliant order. Hut\nthe one great attribute that crowns\nthem all \u2014granting, of course, some\ngift of the other three\u2014but without\nwhich beauty, grace, cleverness are\nall as applet of Sodom\u2014is the sense\nof enjoyment, the gift of happiness.\n1 dot t think 1 can better define it\nthan by tbe word radiance. And best\nof all, radiance is a quality that can\nb( cultivated.\nBeards in Olden Times.\nThe Greeks wore their beards until\nthe time of Alexander, but that great\ngeneral, probably remembering an en\ncounter with bis wife, orderd the Mace\ndonians to be shaved, lest their beards\nshould g_lve a handle to their enemies.\nHeards were worn by the Romans In\n390 I), C.

A couple\nof weeks ago the three started out in the\ncountry for a longer walk than usual.\nThey took the railroad track until they\nhad gone as far as they wished and\nthen made for a country mail on which\nthey proposed home. \u2019 After\ntramping an hour they thought they\nshould be in sight of the city but could\ndiscover no trace of Manitowoc. They\nipuckened their pace for an other half\nhour and still could discover no trace\nof the lost city. Peers thought some\none had run away with the pjace; Sas\nse thought there was some witchcraft\nabout the thing and Levereni\u2019. proposed\nthey camp out and wait for a relief ex\npedition. A farmer passed by and the\nthree hailed him with. \"Say, where\u2019s\nManitowoc\u2019?\u201d The farmer thought\nthey were guying him and wanted to\nlight the crowd. Hasse thought it\nwould be a good plan to mount\nand holler as they used to do In olden\ntime w hen lost in the woods in hope\nthat someone in the city would hear\nand give an answering shout. Their\nqueer maneuvers made the farmers\nsuspicious and when one of the crowd\nwould approach a house to inquire\nabout Manitowoc, lie would he chased\nout of the yard with dogs. Peers went\ninto the woods having heard at one\ntime that persons lost could find ttieir\nway homo by noticing on which side of\nthe tree the moss grew. Put it was as\nhard to find moss as it was to lind the\ncity. In the meantime the farmers\nwere collecting with pitchforks, hoes\nand axes to drive away the three dan\ngerous looking characters who pre\ntended they did not know the way to\nManitowoc. The trio set olf on a run\nand took anew road. They reached\nthe Pranch village by nightfall but\ndidn\u2019t know the place. One of them\ninsisted it was Amigo and that there\nwere a few people there who know\nhim. Another thought it was Hurley\nas they walked far enough to reach\nthat place. The third thought it was\nDepere and pointed to the river as\nproof. They came near having a row\nover the matter but in the nick of\nlime a man approached whom they\nknew. Py round about questions they\nlesrned where they were and hired a\nman to lake them home.\nNow when they go outside the city\nlimits for a walk one of \u2019em walks\nbackwards so as to keep the city from\ngetting awry from them. People who\nmeet them wonder why one fellow pre\nfers to walk backward, but the oilier\ni wo explain that he wras born that way.\nThey take turns in this task and never\nget beyond sight of the city.\nEDUCATIONAL.\n(ByC.

Most of these young people have\ncompleted the work of the elementary\nschools. The schools are located in\nthecountry and are intended primarl'y\nfor country youth. The sciences con\nnected with agriculture are taught,\nbut the greatest emphasis is laid on\nhistory, biography, and literature.\nThe schools then are not vocational\nschools except in a very broad sense.\nThe great object is to awaken the\nintellectual life of the students, lo\nmake them ambitious to live efficient\nly and nobly, and to teach them how\nthis may be accomplished.\nIt is said that 10 per cent of the pop\nulation of Denmark goes through these\nschools. Their popularity is attested\nby the fact that they are supported by\ncooperative effort of the people them\nselves; only very small annual grants\nare received from the government.\n\u2019[\u2019he Folk High Schools are a mighty\nagency :n the life not only of the rural\ncommunities hut of the nation at large.\nFive members of the Denmark cabinet\narc from the Folk High Schools, four\nof these are farmers. Many members\nof the lower house of parliament are\nalso from these schools. Eighty per\ncent of the officials and managers in\nthe cooperative agricultural societies\nand enterprises have attended Folk\nHigh Schools.\nThe results achieved hy these schools\nare a good example of the remarkable\nresults which can lie achieved when\nthe people are given the kind of educa\ntion which they really need.\nDISEASES OF SCftOOLCHILDREN.\nTuhercu'osis of the lungs is the lead\ning cause of deaths among American\nchildren during the period of school\nlife, Next in order ere incidents,\nO.TORRISON COMPANY\nTATE Extend to All Our\n* * Best Wishes for a\nProsperous and Happy New\nYear and Wish to Thank\nYou for the share of patron\nage with which you have\nfavored us ...\nWe are now in the midst of our\nannual inventory taking and\nbeginning with January 2nd you\nwill find throughout the entire\nstore unusual bargains priced so\nlow that if money-saving is the\nobject you should look through\nthe different departments . .\nO.

Early in th'c\nday Matzi was arrested on a charge of\npetty larceny made by William Schnei\nder, a contractor, and after he had se\ncured an adjournment of this hearing\nuntil next Tuesday, Matzi himself be\ncame a plaintiff and isecured a civil\nwarrant for the arrest of William F.\nHoward and Essie O. Reading, two well\nknown contrac ors. He charged them\nwith tresspass alleging that the cor trac\ntors had entered a house on the west\nside after Matzi had taken possession\nof it under a contract to secure a land\ncontract. The land contract had not\nbeen drawn, but M.atzi alleged that he\nwas in possession of the premises.\nHoward and Reading declared that they\nhad entered the place as contractors to\nfinish up work which had been con\ntracted for before Matzi took posses\nsion They declared that they had the\n-perrtrtfsioh of Matzi and his wife to\nenter the premises. The hearing of the\ntrespass e xse is still on at the municipal\ncourt thi: afternoon but the evidence\nindieated(that the contractors had the\nbetter of the argument.\nNEW FIGURES MONDAY.\nWisconsin Gas and Electric Co. to Sub\nmit Figures for New Light Contract\nAt the first meeting of the common\ncouncil for the new year to be held on\nnext Monday evening the Wisconsin\nGas and Electric company will submit\nto the council figures for a new lighting\ncontract. R. B. Way, vice president\nand manager of the electrical depart\nment of the company has been busy\nworking out the proposition for several\nweeks and he will come to Kenosha on\nMonday ready to submit his figures.\nNo indication as to the amount to be\nasked for the lights has been allowed\nto creep out of the offices of the com\npany and the proposition will be a\ncomplete surprise to the members of\nthe council. The company has made a\nformal petition to the mayor asking\nthat the hours for lighting in Kenosha\nbe changed. The suggestion is that the\nlights be started eight minutes earlier\nin the eveniug and turned off eight min\nutes earlier in the morning. This will\nmake the schedule in Kenosha conform,\nwith tne's* 1 nodule now in use in other\ncities in the state. It is probable that\nthe council will give its sanction to the\nchange in the schedule.\nMARRIED AT FOND DU LAC.\nMiss Grace Morris Becomes Bride of\nTheodore Hettrick Today.\nA wedding of great interest to many\nKenosha people was celebrated at St.\nJoseph church at Fond du Lac this\nmorning w'hen Miss Grace Morris,\ndaughter of Mr. and Mrs. C.

The machine room will be\none story, 85x120 feet, and adjoining it\nwill be four new dry kilns. These kilns\nwill be each 18x120 feet in size. The\ncompany installed its present kilns\nseven years ago but the system now in\nuse has become antiquated and the\nplans for the coming year provide for\nthe installation of the latest kilns of\nthe Morton company. These, when com\npleted, will give the. company a capac\nity of 40,000 feet of dry lumber daily.\nThe next building will be a new power\nplant and this plant will provide for a\nchange from steam to electric power.\nIt is the plan cf the company to change\nover the pqwer of the entire plant as\nrapidly as possible and electric units of\nthe most modern kind will be installed.\nAnother building is a glue room which\nwill be used for veneering. This build\ning will be two stories in height and\n60x220 feet. With this space the busi\nness of the company may be greatly\nenlarged. The last building in the new\nplans is a great storage warehouse two\nstories in height and 60x122 feet in\nsize.\n\u201cWe are planning to double the ca\npacity of the plant,\u201d said L. T. Han\nnahs m discussing the plans of the\ncompany this morning. \u201cWe appre\nciate that this building work will take\nsome time but we expect to rush the\noperations as much as possible. Growth\nof the business along many lines has\nmade necessary these big additions to\nthe plant. We desire to take care of\nthe business in the best possible man\nner and in order to keep abreast of the\ngrowing business a very large increase\nin capacity has been demanded.\u201d\nThe Hannahs company has been\ngrowing by leaps and bounds in the\npast few years and the plant is now\none of the largest of the kind in the\ncountry. Its growth lias been a matter\nof especial interest to the people of\nKenosha on account of the fact that it\nhas been the product of local brains and\nlocal capital. The company hopes to\ncomplete all of the new buildings\nplanned by the end of 1914. Of course\nthis large increase in the size of the\nplant will bring a corresponding in\ncrease in the number of men to be em\nployed by the company. The company\nhas in recent months purchased land as\nsites for the new buildings and no fur\nther land will be required to carry out\nthe plans.\nMARRIED AT WAUKEGAN.\nNels Nelson and Katherine Ryan Have\nTrouble Fighting Railway Conductors.\nThere was a Kenosha wedding at\nWaukegan on Tuesday afternoon when\nMiss Katherine Ryan and Nels Kelson,\nboth well known among the young peo\nple of Kenosha, were married at the\nparsonage of one of the Waukegan\nchurches. The wedding was not with\nout a feature as the bride and groom\nhad considerable trouble having their\nwishes carried out. They had planned\nto be married by a minister who had\nofficiated at a wedding of the bride\u2019s\nsister a year ago, but when they reach\ned Waukegan they were besieged by\nconductors on the street ears who were\nseeking marriage business for one of\nthe Waukegan justices.

It has been a year of joy and\nsorrow in Kenosha and it has brought\nits blessings and its pains. The year\nhas not been a notable one along any\nlines and there have been few great\nevents to make it stand out prominent\nly in the history of the city. Regarded\nas a hoo-doo year from the start peo\nple have dreaded the coming of calami\nties, yet few years have found less as\ncidents in Kenosha. There have, of\ncourse, been shadows in many hearts,\nbut these have been counterbalanced\nby joys in the hearts of others. The\ndeath rate in Kenosha during the year\nhas been a normal one. The city has\nbeen free from any serious scourge of\ncontagious disease, this being in\nstrange contrast to the preceding year.\nThere has been an unusually large\namount of crime in the city during the\ntwelve months and the courts have been\ncorrespondingly busy.\nIn the affairs of the municipality the\nyear has been one of many accomplish\nments. There has been large extensions\nof the paving and sewer systems of the\ncity. Much has been done along lines\nof systematizing the affairs of the var\nious departments and commissions un\nder city rule. The old trunk sewer\nclaim bogey laid over to 1913 by the\nformer year has been dispose! of in a\nmanner favorable to the city and fair\nto the contractors. Ashland avenue has\nbeen opened. The city has had much\ntrouble during the year in seeking to\nsecure better service from public utili\nty corporations but with the closing\nof the year it appears that most of\nthese problems have been satisfactorily\nmet. The new north side trunk sewer\nhas been started and is nearing comple\ntion, plans are under way to secure\nfiltration for the city water. The big\ngest problem that is being left over to\nthe new year is the problem of ar\nranging the tracks of the North-\nWestern Railway Company aud the\nproblem of securing the entrance of the\ninterurban cars to the heart of the\ncity. This problem was solved early\nin .1913, but the solution was found to\nbe an incomplete one.\nFinancially, the year has been a bet\nter one for the city than the preceding\none and, while taxes are higher than in\n1912, this was made necessary by the\ngreat increase in the state taxes.\nThe Industrial Year,\nAmong the industries of Kenosha\n1913 was a freak year. Up to the first\nof November it' gave promise of prov\ning a record breaking year so the man\nufacturers, but the last two months of\nthe year have brought a slump. This\nis declared to be only temporary and\nmanufacturers agree that the opening\nof the new year will see nearly all the\nworkmen of Kenosha back in their old\npositions. No new industries of any\ngreat size have been established in the\ncity but a number of small plants have\nbeen opened and these promise to grow\ninto much greater industries before the\nend of another year. Many of the lo\ncal plants have made large additions\nduring the year and the number of em\nployed men and women in the city lias\nbeen increased.\nSchools Broaden Out.\nOne of the notable developments of\nthe year just closing was the broaden\ning out of the w'ork of the publie\nschool system. Kenosha has done much\ntoward extending practical education\nfor its working classes and the city is\ndeclared to be a model for other cities\nin the state. Coupled with these move\nments have been movements for larger\nand better schools and for the build\ning of the new high school. The play\nground movement has been one of the\nreal live questions in Kenosha during\nthe year and plans which have matured\npromise to offer an early solution for\nthis problem in Kenosha.\nActive work has been done during\nthe year toward the extension of the\npark system of the city. This is cer\ntain to bear fruit within another year.\nNotable among the year\u2019s accomplish\nments in the city was the completion\nof the wall about the Kenosha ceme\ntery. This is regarded as one of the\nOldest Paper\nIn\nThe Northwest\nNUMBER 36\nmost beautiful and substantial pieces\nof work ever done in Wisconsin.\nKenosha has added quo new church\nduring the year, the St. Anthony's\nchurch having been opened only a few\nmonths ago.\nThe most notable events of the year,\narranged in chronological order, fol\nlow:\nJanuary.\n3.

Towers, A. 8., J. of the\nMichigan Bar.\nWho Owns the Air?\n\u201cFree as air\u201d is ard\nso long as man had not succeeded in\nmastering the air this was true\nenough. There was air sufficient\nfor f I of us and as none could nay\nigate it with any success, questions\nof the control of the air did not\narise.\nBut now we the aeroplane\nand the airship and we are ; n what\npromises to be the beginning of an\nage of aviation. So it is that the\nlaw is beginning to develop: to keep\npace with the development of aero\nnautics. As yet flying machines are\nfew in number, but it seems that\nwe may well look forward to a time\nin the not far distant future when\nthe passage of aeroplanes and air\nships above us will be no uncom\nmon spectacle. What right has the\naeronaut to pass above our proper\nty? What are his liabilities in case\nhe causes injuries to those below\nhim? These and many similar\nquestions are arising, and the law\nis preparing to answer them as\nthey arise.\nIf one passes over your land, on\nthe surface, without your permis\nsion, be has committed a tresspass\nand though he may have caused no\nappreciable damage to your prem\nises, you may recover small dama\nges in a court of law by way of vin\ndication of your rights. What are\nyour rights against the aeronaut\nwho passes through the air above\nyour property? It is a fundamental\nrule of English law that a person\u2019s\nproperty extends indefinitely down\nward and indefinitely upward. This\nrule has existed since the beginn\nings of law, and qnder it one has\ncontrol of the area above his land.\nA strict observance of this rule\nwould lead to this result: An aero\nnaut who passes above your land is\na technical trespasser, and though\nhe drops nothing upon you or yours,\nthough he cause you no real injury,\nhe has violated your rights \u2014he has\ntrespassed\u2014and you may sue him\nand recover damages. Such would\nbe the logical result of the applica\ntion of the law as it has long exist\ned in English-speaking countries.\nBut it seems highly improbable\nthat the law will be allowed to re\nmain in this condition. Aviation\nhas come to stay and it would seem\nto be a necessity that aeronauts be\nallowed to pass freely over the\nproperty beneath, whether it be pri\nvately owned or a public highway.\nThis necessity seems certain to\ncause a change in the law, which is\nlikely to come in the form of legis\nlative enactments concerning flying\nmachines. The French have already\ntaken action, a law having been re\ncently enacted which extends to\naeronauts free right to navigate the\nair, passing where they will. The\nnation retains the general control\nof the air, however, so that it may\nprevent any but French airships\nfrom flying over French territory,\nand make such regulations as may\nbe necessary.\nAmong the American states Con\nnecticut has taken the lead in pas\nsing legislation of this character.\nA law entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning\nthe Registration, Numbering, and\nUse of Air Ships, and the Licensing\nof Operators Thereof\u201d was passed\nby that state in 1911. Under this\nlaw airships are subject to rules\nsimilar to those generally applied\nto automobiles. The owner must\nfile certain information with the\nSec. of State, pay a fee, receive a\ncertificate entitling him to fly, and\na number. This number must be\ndisplayed on the airship in letters\nnot less than three feet in height.\nAirships may be operated only by\nlicensed aeronauts.\nThis law fixes the responsibility\nfor all resulting damages in the fol-\nWE WISH YOU ALL A HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS NEW YEAR.\nThe River Falls Journal\nlowing section:\n\u201cEvery aeronaut shall be respon\nsible f>r all damages suffered in\nthis state by any >- son from injuries\ncaused by any voyage in an airship\ndirected by such aeronaut; aud if\nhe be the agent or employee of an\nother in making such voyage his\nprincipal or employer shall be re\nsponsible for such damage.\u201d\nThe states of Massachusetts and\nNew York are considering similar\nlegislation and before many years\nit seems probable that every state\nwill have acted on this subject.\nThe question of fixing the respon\nsibility for damages, which b\u00abs\nb ;en cared for in the Connecticut\nact, is one that is likely to be of\nimmediate importance. The dan\ngers of airships passing over prop\nerty are considerable. Parts, bag\ngage, or ballast might be dropped,\ncausing injury to persons or pro\nperty beneath. The fall of an aero\nplane upon a city might occasion\nsevere damage to those on land, as\nwell as to the unfortunate aeronaut\nBut fancy the damage resulting\nfrom the collision between two\ngiant airships of the Zepplin type\nWith the present interest in avia\ntion and the popular encourage\nment which it is receiving, the atti\ntude of the lawmakers is likely to\nbe favorable to them as far as\ngranting to them the right to freely\nuse the air is concerned Landown\ners are not likely to endeavor to de\nmand a fee from aeronauts passing\nover their property. The legisla\ntors are likely to grant great free\ndom of passage and the courts are\nlikely to sustain the legislation. Of\ncourse, a property owner might ob\nject that when the legislature grants\nthe right to navigate the air freely\nit gives a right to pass over his\nland and thus takes away from him\na portion of his property. Such a\ncontention, if made, will raise some\ninteresting cases, the result of\nwhich no one can foresee.\nBut as to fixing the responsibility\nfor injury resulting from the opera\ntion of airships, the law seems in\ndined to hold the aeronaut to strict\naccount. If the aeronaut wishes to\ntake the risk of riding in the air, he\nmust further take all the risk of\ncausing injury to persons or prop\nerty over which he passes. As mat\nters stand now, even in the absence\nof a statute fixing the responsibili\nties, as in Connecticut, a person in\njured by an airship may almost cer\ntainly recover damages from the\naeronaut. If a passing airship lets\ntall any object which injures your\nproperty you may sue the person\nwho is responsible for the operation\nof the airship.\nA few cases have already arisen\nin England. A British aeronaut\nwas driving his aeroplane and at\ntempted to descend into a field. The\nfield was occupied by a cow and the\ncow apparently resented the appear\nance of this strange object from\nabove. As the aeroplane descended\nthe cow rushed toward it, making\nhostile demonstrations. The aero\nnaut endeavored to avoid the infur\niated bovine, but was unsuccessfull\nand her cowship succeeded in plung\ning beneath the machine just as it\nreached the earth. The resu.ts\nwere disasterous to the cow, and\nthe sequel came when the farmer\nwho owned the cow sued the aero\nnaut and recovered damages for\nthe loss of the cow.\nThe aeroplane has found its way\ninto the classified ad columns as\nwell as into the courts, as witness\nhe following interesting ad which\nappeared in a German newspaper:\n\u201cLost from an aeroplane, a gold\nwatch and chain.

WIS., JANUARY 2. 1914-\nMeal Inspection\nThe United Stales government pro\nvides for inspection of all meat picking\nplants which are engaged in interstate\nand foreign commerce. The, methods\nemployed in large plants are exceedingly\ninteresting. First, an inspection is made\nof all live animals and \"suspects\u201d arc\nculled for especially careful observation\nand regulated handling. After slaugh\nter, each nrocess in the further prepara\ntion of the carcass for the market, is\ncarefully watched The inspectors be\ncome highly skilled in the detection of\nevidences of diseased tissue which passes\nunder their eyes and hands.\nAs in the case of the first live Inspec\ntion upon the first suspicion of disease,\nan indelible brand sir-pends further prep\naration of the meat. The carcass is then\nshipped to a special examining room for\nfurther study and final disposition. By\nthis means, to reach the consumer the\nbody of a diseased animal would have to\npass the marvelously keen observation of\na number of highly skilled inspectors.\nThe diseases most often found are\ntuberculosis and actinomycosis in cattle;\ntuberculosis, hog cholera and various\nblood and organic diseases in swine.\nSome states have provided for inspec\ntion of abattoirs not under federal juris\ndiction. Wisconsin has made no such\nprovision. Dealers are sometimes sus\npected of offering for sale to inspected\npacking houses, only those animals which\nare presumably healthy. If this be so,\nmeat from uninspected slaughter houses\nis apt to be considerably below the nor\nmal average as concerns freedom from\ndisease.\nIn addition to the detection of diseased\nmeat, the inspectors maintain a close\nsnr yell lance over the general cleanliness\nof the plant. If the packers ever resent\ned the rigid demands of the government,\nno such resentment is now manifest.\nUndoubtedly, they recognize the govern\nment stamp of approval to he of distinct\ncommercial value.\nWonderful Cough Remedy\nDr. King\u2019s New Discovery is known\neverywhere as the remedy which will\nsuwily stop a cough or*culd.

K.\nDoarholt of Milwaukee, director of the\nhealth bureau of the University of Wis\nconsin Extension division, and secretary\nof the organization.\n\u2018\u2018The must certain means of prevent\ning the spread of a weed pest is to gather\ncarefully and burn the seed,\" continued\nDoctor Dowrholt. Likewise, the most\ncertain way of preventing the spread of\nconsumption is to burn the seed.\n\u201cGerms of consuption are contained in\nthe expectorations of patients suffering\nfrom the disease. Therefore if all ex\npectorations were carefully gathered\nin special cups, napkins and papers\nand burned before any of the seed\nwore scattered, tuberculosis would\nbecome historical. Karly knowledge at\nthe stage when the disease is most easily\ncured requires skillful diagnosis and\npatients should consult a skillful physi\ncian on first suspicion of infection, in\ndividuals who have been subjected to\nprolonged contact should have periodic\nexaminations extending over a number\nof years.\n\u201cProviding sanitarium cure for ad\nvanced consumptives in a great measure\ncuts off the sources of infection. But a\nsufllcient number of sanatorium beds\nCan not be secured In a month or a year.\nAnd some patients may never consent to\ngo to a sanatorium. lienee we must pro\nvide as good protection as is possible\nfrom consumptives in the home. We can\naccomplish this by the visiting nurse\nand a wider knowledge of the funda\nmental facts in connection with the\nnature, cure, and prevention of the\ndisease.\"\nHog Cholera Don\u2019ts\nThe following precautions are recom\nmended for keeping hog cholera from\nan uninfected drove by H T. Galloway,\nAsst. Sec. of Agriculture.\n1. Do not locate hog lots near a pul lie\nhighway, a railroad or n stream. The\ngerm of hog cholera may bo carried along\nany one of these avenues.\n2. Do not allow strangers or neighbors\nto enter your hog lots, and do not go in\nto your neighbors\u2019 lots. If Is is absolute\nly necessary to pass from one hog lot in\nto another, lirst clean your shoes care\nfully and then wash them with a 21 per\ncent solution of the compound solution\nof crosol (U. S. P.)\n3. Do not put now slock, either hogs\nor cuttle, in lots with a herd already on\nthe farm. Newly purchased hogs should\nbe put in separate enclosures well sepa\nrated from the herd on the farm and\nkept under observation for three weeks,\nbecause practically all stock cars, un\nloading chutes, and pens are infected\nwith hog cholera, and hogs shipped by\nrail are therefore apt to contract hog\ncholera.\n4. Hogs sent to fairs should be quar\nantined for at least three weeks after\nthey return to the farm.\n5. If hog cholera breaks out on a\nfarm, separate the sick from the appar\nently healthy animals, and burn all car\ncasses of death. Do not leave* them mi\nburned, or this will endanger all other\nfarmers in the neighborhood.\n<5. If after the observance of all possi\nble precautions hog cholera appears on\nyour farm, notify the State veterinarian,\nor State Agricultural college, and secure\nserum for the treatment of those not\naffected. The early application of tills\nserum Is essential.\nSome of these precautions may seem\nunnecessary and troublesome, but they\ndo not cost much, and they are very\nvaluable preventive measures.\nThe Tax Kate\nThe tax rate in this city for the cur\nrent year is $16,00 per $1,0)0 in the Jef\nferson county wards and $18.13 in the\nDodge county wards* If the assesnirnt\nIs 90 per cent of the actual value, the\nrate is excessive: if the asnessed valua\ntion is moderate then the rate Is reason\nable \u2014on the whole however Watertown\nhas no cause for complaint, below we\ngive the tax rate per 11,000 in some of\nthe other cities of the state:\nAn tigo $29.00, Bar a boo $23, 01, Beaver\nDarn s23.2o, Hoscobel S2B 00, Beloit $17.4b,\nBurlington $24,07, Edgerton 118.94, Kan\nClaire $23.50, Jefferson SIB.BO, Madison\n$16.50, Monroe $17.00, Oshkosh sl7 50,\nPltttteville 117.23, Portage $20.00, Janes\nville $15.00, Milwaukee 118.00, La Crosse\n$25,00, Richland Center $29.40, Toinah\n$20.12, Btonghton $18.70, Whitewater\n$25.90, W aterloo $17.94, Waukesha $19.50,\nLake Geneva $23.81,\nAn Ideal Woman\u2019s Laxative\nWho wants to take salts, or castor oil,\nwhen there is nothing better than Dr.\nKing\u2019s New Life Pills for all bowel\ntroubles.

Sonne\nund Planeten erscheinen n\u00e4mlich, we\ngen ihrer gr\u00f6\u00dferen Entfernung, als\nKreise oder Ellipsen, und so ist ihre\ngenaue Ortsbestimmung nicht beson\nders schwierig; der Mond dagegen\nerscheint nicht kreis- oder ellipsen\nf\u00f6rmig begrenzt, und daher lie\u00df sich\nbisher sein Mittelpunkt oder Schwer\nPunkt nickt genau genug bestimmen.\nMan sucht: bisher diesem Uebelstande\ndurch E'i'f\u00fcvrung eines \u201eFixpunttes\"\nabzuhelfen, dessen selenographEche\nKoordinaten bestimmt wurden.

So gaben zu\nAnfang des Krieges verschiedene der\n\u00e4g\u00e4ischen Inseln besondere Briefmar\nker, heraus, z. B. Jkanen, Mytilenr,\nSamos und Lemnos. Griechenland\nversah die in den eroberten Gebieten\nverwendeten Marken mit einem be\nsonderen Ueberdruck, und neuerdings\nhat auch der werdende Staat Alba\nnien sich schon mit der Herausgabe\nvon eigenen Briefmarken befa\u00dft. Zu\nerst verwendete man dort t\u00fcrkisch\nMarken, die mit einem h\u00f6chst primi\ntiven albanischen Adler \u00fcberdruckt\n'Wurden. In der letzten Zeit aber hat\nman'einen regelw-chten Stempel ange\nfertigt, welcher die Inschrift tr\u00e4gt\n\u201ePostat c Qeverrics se Perlohefhme\":\ndiese Marke wurde in den Werten zu\n2E Para und l Piaster herausgege\nben, d. h. die Postbeamten stellen sie\nselbst her. indem sie diesen Stempel\nauf ein St\u00fcck Papier drucken und auf\nden ihnen \u00fcbergebenen Brief Neben.\nGriechenland hat den Briefmarken\nsammlern im legten Stadium noch\neine ganze Reihe bon provisorischen\nMarken beschert, die zu den seltensten\ngeh\u00f6ren, welche seit Ansang dieses\nJahrhundcris \u00fcberhaupt ausgegeben\nwurden. So hatten die Bulgaren in\nder f\u00fcr einige Zeit besetzten Hafen\nstadt Kawalla iyr eigenen Marlen\neingef\u00fchrt. AIS die Griechen diesen\nOrt einnahmen, fanden sie einen klei\nne Nest dieser Marken vor und ver\nsahen sie schnell mit einem griechischen\nAusdruck. Von einzelnen dieser Pi\"\nvisoricn sind nur 10 St\u00fcck hergestellt,\nwodurch sich ihre Seltenheit erkl\u00e4rt.\nAls die griechische Floite vor Dedca\ngatsch lag, wurden auf ihren Schiffen\nBriefe zur Weiterbef\u00f6rderung ange\nnommen. In Ermangelung von\nMarken fertigte man amtlich recht\neckige Papierst\u00fccke an, die mit einer\ngriechischen Inschrift und der Wert\nangabe bedruckt wurden. Als diese\nVorr\u00e4te zu Ende gingen, nahm man,\nwie in Kawalla. bulgarische Marken\nund bedruckte sie \u00e4hnlich wie dort.\nSehr selten sind auch die in G\nm\u00fcldschina ausgegebenen Provisorien\nzu 10 und 25 Lepta. Diese Stadt\nwar urspr\u00fcnglich von den Bulgaren\nerobert, wurde aber dann von den\nGriechen besetzt. Im Autarkster\nFrieden sie! sic wieder an Bulgarien,\ndoch tonnte dieses sie nicht sofort be\nsitzen, soda\u00df die griechische Besatzung\nl\u00e4nger dorr bleiben mu\u00dfte. W\u00e4hrend\ndieser Zeit hat man nun t\u00fcriische\nBricsmar'en, die inan vorfand, mit\neinem mehrzelligen Ueberdruck in\ngriechischer Sprache versehen und\nauch noch das griechische Wappen hin\nzugef\u00fcgt.

The federate\u2019\nfire has been much \u2019ess effective than\nthe rebels\u2019, causing observers to be\nlieve the former are conserving their\npowder supply to resist the final rebel\ncharge.\nThe federal demoralization which\nappeared to have begun last night,\nwas checked today and there were\nfewer desertions to the American side\nof the. border than at any time since\nthe battle began Monday afternoon.\nMaj. McNamee\u2019s American border pa\ntrol had little to do.\nIt was learned here today that $70,-\n500 in Mexican money, brought here\nWednesday to pay the Ojinaga federal\ntroops, had been stolen. No clue to\nthe thieves had been found.\nBefore the wires were cut, enough\nwas learned to show that the federate\nwere 'n a hopeless position. After hav\ning resisted in an almost superhuman\nmanner, a steady artillery fire lasting\n30 hours, the federal forces were badly\ndemoralized and a precipitate flight to\nthe American side of the border was\nexpected.\nIn fact, last dispatches indicated\ncated that this flight had already be\ngun. It was estimated that fully 1,500\nfederal soldiers had crossed or had at\ntempted to cross the Rio Grande river.\nThose of the fugitives who were\nwounded were allowed to remain, but\nthe others were forced back to Ojinaga\nby American troops, after having been\ndisarmed.\nIt has been impossible to get an ac\ncurate estimate ct the deau and\nwounded. The only thing refugees\nwould say was that \u201cat least 500\nbodies lie in the streets of Ojinaga,\u201d\nand that 1,000 are wounded.\nThe hills around Ojinaga made it\npossible for the federals to pour a\nheavy fire into the rebel trenches.\n.

Friday morning, promptly, on the opening of the county clerk s\noffice, Tilden Mull, aged 37, Richmond, Ind., appeared with a request\nfor a license to marry Minnie Perchbacher. aged 22, 305 Fourteenth\nstreet. Mull came in alone and without a doctor\u2019s certificate. He was\ntold he must have one.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good law,\u201d said Mull. \u201cI\u2019ll go out and get one.\nMull was the first to ask for a license in 1914, but the test of the,\nlaw will probably come through Albert A. Petersen, a machinist, aged\n29, 534 Jefferson street. Petersen came in with one of the old blanks\nfilled out, and accompanied by Attorney Harry R. McLogan. Ue\nwanted to marry Hattie J. SchmidJ, aged 29, 703 Forty-eighth street.\nThe application was refused. The attorney advised Petersen to\ngo out and prepare one of the new blanks and get a definite refusal\nfrom County Clerk Widule, after which court procedure could be\nresorted to.\n\u201cWhat we propose to do,\u201d said McLogan, \u201cis to fill out one of the\nnew blanks and then go to various physicians and tender the $3 for\nan examination.\n\"Upon their refusal to make the examination for the amount\ntendered, we will prepare affidavits that physicians refuse to make\nthe examinations for the amount specified in the law and show that it\nis impossible to comply with the law. A writ of mandamus will then\nbe applied for.\n\u201cI am not- opposed to the principle of the new law\u2019,\u201d McLogan\nadded, \"but it should be attacked, because as it now stands it will tend\nto swerve public opinion away from the principle involved in /t.\u201d\nSOCIALIST CMT\nDOHmiNG\nWITH BUIE ROSE\nThe constitution of the Social-Dem\nocratic party deciares that any mem\nber of the party who enters into a\npolitical trade with a capitalist party,\nor any of its candidates, must be ex\npelled.\nVictor L. Berger pointed to this\nfact Friday, in an interview regard-^\ning rumors that Health Commissioner\nKraft and his friends is planning to\nsupport David S. Rose in his candi\ndacy for mayor.\n\u201cAccording to The Daily News, the\nMilwaukee Germania Herold and oth\ner capitalistic sources, the Bellamy\nclub is to take a hand in the next\nmunicipal election in behalf of David\nS. Rose,\u201d said Victor L. Berger, Fri\nday.\n\u201cShortly after the last municipal\nelection a club was formed in the city\nand named the Bellamy club. Its\nprime movers were Health Commis\nsioner Kraft, who became president,\nand William J. Eberle, secretary of\nthe health department, who was made\nsecretary. The former residence of a\nmillionaire brewer was rented and\nfitted up as a home for the club.\nKraft a New Coiner.\n\u201cDr. Kraft was comparatively young\nin the party when he was appointed\nhealth commissioner. W. J. Eberle\nhad come here from Pittsburgh or\nChicago about the time of our victory\nin this city and had managed to get\nthe appointment of secretary to the\nhealth commissioner.\n\u201cBoth Dr. Kraft and Mr. Eberle\nsoon felt that the party, and- especially\nThe Leader were all wrong and mis\nmanaged. They also felt that their\nefforts in keeping the drinking water\nfree from poisoning before election\nhad not been sufficiently appreciated\nby the party and The Leader \u2014and the\ngentlemen were correspondingly sore.\n\u201cTherefore, under the guise of be\ning a sociable club purely, the Bel\nlamy club, from its very beginning,\nwas supposed to be the fortress of dis\ngruntled, half-intellectual and semi\nbourgeois office holders, past, present\nand future, as opposed to the prole\ntarian, common and uncompromising\nred Socialist \u2018gang\u2019 at Brisbane hall.\nThere is no doubt, however, that the\nmajority of the club members, and\nespecially the young men and women,\nare loyal and w/dl meaning Socialists,\nwho have simply joined the club to\ntake advantage of any social and edu\ncational features the club might offer.\nNot a Socialist Club.\n\u2018The Social-Democratic party has\nabsolutely no jurisdiction over the\nBellamy club, which admits and has\nadmitted many non-Socialists as\nmembers. The Leader, therefore, nev\ner has taken any cognizance of the\nhostility of its shining lights, but has,\non the contrary, reported the doings\nof the club in a liberal and friendly\nmanner.\n\u201cHowever. recent developments\nare compelling a change in our at\ntitude. Capitalist papers have, in\nlong articles, reported an alliance, or\na probable alliance, between Dr. Kraft\nand other leading spirits of the Bel\nlamy club with ex-Mayor Rose, who\nis again a candidate for mayor, the\nobject of the alliance to be the re\nelection of Rose and the reappoint\nment of Dr. Kraft.\nIn a hu\u2019f-hearted denial Dr. Kraft\nexplains that the long interview which\nhe held behind closed doors with Mr.\nRose wa3 simply in reference to the\nFriedman serum in which both gen\ntlemen seem to be interested. But the\nrumors still persist. And some\nprominent members of the health de\npartment continue to give them a\nbasis by their utterances.\n\u201cTherefore, the time has come to\nspeak plainly. While the party has\nno more control over the Bellamy club\nthan over the Jeffei^on club or the\nBon Ami club, according to our nat\nional and state constitution, any party\nmember who enters into any alliance\nwith a candidate of capitalist parties\nmust be unceremoniously and dis\ngracefully expelled. And this para\ngraph of the constitution still holds\ngood for Dr. Kraft and Mr. Eberle.\n\u201cAs to the disgraceful fight between\nDr. Kraft and Dr.. Riley, in which\nfight the Democratic sheriff had to\ntake a hand, I can say nothing at this\ntime because as far as we have been\nable to learn, it is purely a personal\naffair of Dr. Kraft and Dr. Riley. The\nparty, the public and the patients are\nsimply the innocent bystanders. But\npossibly the central committee may\ntake up the whole affair.\u201d\nPRICE, TWO CENTS.\nRILEY RESISTS\nOUSTERASHEAD\nOFWORM\nA hearing is scheduled to be held in\nJudge Eschweiler\u2019s branch of the cir\ncuit court Saturday morning in the in\njunction proceedings instituted against\nHealth Commissioner Kraft by Dr. D.\nB.

Ernst,\nwho was granted a leave of absence\nuntil Feb. 1, 1914, that he might take\na wedding trip to Germany.\nDr. Ernst returned to Milwaukee\nFriday morning and announced his\nwillingness to immediately resume\ncharge at the sanatorium, according to\nannouncement made by Dr. Kraft.\n\u201cDr. Riley is out automatically, with\nthe return of Dr. Ernst,\u201d said Kraft.\nKraft sent a letter to Sheriff Law\nrence McGreal Friday, asking him to\ndesist from supplying deputy sheriffs\nfor duty at the sanatorium. Kraft an\nnounced that he would appeal to Gov.\nMcGovern to take action against Mc-\nGreal for his act.\nInsubordination is the charge on\nwhich Kraft dismissed Riley. The\ncommissioner declares that the nam\ning of Riley was an emergency ap\npointment and that he is within his\nrights in discharging him. Under the\nprovisions of the charter.

W 7 hile the miners\nmay not demand formal recognition of\nthe federation, they will insist that\naffiliation with that organization\nshould not be prohibited.\nAlthough all mine operators in the\ndistrict today refused to be quoted, it\nwas learned that their desire to effect\na settlement of the strike before a\ncongressional inquiry could be started\nwas responsible for theii\u2019 agreement to\nconsider Lensmore\u2019s peace plans.\nThree meetings ushered in the new\nyear in the copper empire. They were\nall held in Hancock.\nOne, held in the town hall, was part\nof the \u201cback to work\u201d campaign car\nried on by the copper barons, ft was\nattended by five strike breakers.

The\nmoney was raised by his Milwaukee\nfriends immediately after Reddin\u2019s\nconviction, together with that of his\nfellow workers, Dec. 28, 1912, at Indi\nanapolis, Ind.\nSix men were granted new trials.\nThey are: Olaf A. Tveitmoe, San\nFrancisco; James E. Ray, Peoria, 111.;\nRichard 11. Iloulinan, Chicago; Wil\nliam .1. McCain, Kansas City; Fred\nSherman, Indianapolis; William Bern\nhardt, Cincinnati.\nThe sentences which had been im\nposed on the men granted new trials\nwere:\nTveitmoe, six years; Ray, two years,\ntwo days; Houlihan, two years, two\ndays; McCain, three years; Sherman,\nthree years, two days; Bernhardt, one\nyear, one day.\nJudges Seamon, Becker and Kohl\nsaat heard the appeal of the convicted\nunion heads. Judge Seamon today\nread the opinion.\nError Pleas Overruled.\nThe circuit court of appeals over\nruled all the general challenges in er\nror, made by attorneys for the con\nvicted men, and on this ground denied\nnew trials to the 24 men sentenced to\nserve terms in Leavenworth peniten\ntiary. The claims of the defense over\nrule d we re these:\nThat the lower court erred in con\nsolidating the indictments and in\noverruling a motion to vacate this or\nder.\nThat the lower court erred in per\nmitting McManigal and Clark, two of\nihe defendants, to be used as govern\nment witnesses.\nThat the lower court erred in over\nruiing motions and demurrers made\nto the evidence, in overruling a mo\ntion to compel the government to elect\nwhether it should prosecute the de\nfendants under the indictments al\nleging conspiracy or under the charge\nof aiding and abetting a conspiracy,\nand in instructing the jury.\nThe court also overruled the prin\ncipal claim set up by the defense \u2014\nthat a continuing conspiracy had not\nbeen proven, and held that the evi\ndence showed \u201ca continuing and dom\ninating conspiracy against the United\nStates.\u201d\nIn reversing the convictions of the\nsix defendants, the court held that the\nevidence in their eases was insuffi\ncient and remanded their cases to the\ndistrict court for new trial. In the\nmeantime they will remain at liberty.\nAppeal Not Decided On.\nCounsel for the defense has not de\ntermined whether an appeal will be\ntaken to the United States supreme\ncourt in the cases of the 24 whose\nconvictions were affirmed.\nAttorney E. N. Zoline, after the de\ncision was read, said he would offer\na formal motion to defer the case of\nthe 2 1 men until he could secure a\nmore perfect appeal to the supreme\ncourt.\n\"You have 30 days, as a matter of\ncourse, in which to act,\u201d said Judge\nSeamon.\nZoline announced that the consul\ntation between the defense attorneys\nwould take place in a few days and\nformal action taken.\nThe court held that there wa; an\nasufiicient amount of testimony to\nhold the six men granted a new trial.\n\u201cWo are of the opinion that the\ngovernment failed to prove a prima\nfacie case of co-partnership in the\nohenses charged in the indictment\nagainst any of them,\u201d held the court.\n\u201cAU except Tvietmoe were affiliated\nwith the International Association of\n\u2018Bridge and Structural Ironworkers,\nand their sympathy and general par\nticipation in the objects and the poli\ncies may be rightly assumed from the!\nevidence but we are advised of proof!\nto charge any of them with victual\nnartieipation in the commission of the\noffenses charged in the indictment.\u201d\nReferring to the conviction of\nTveitmoc, of San Francisco, a Pacific\ncoast labor leader, the court held that!\nwhile his \u201csympathies with the Inter\nnational Association we re apparent,!\nthey do not prove complicity or serve \u25a0\nto uphold conviction, without evi-I\ndence of personal indentificarion with i\nthe conspiracy.\u201d\nAppeals Are Denied.\nThe court denied the appeals of the\nso 11 ow in g iro nwo rk ers:\nFrank M.

However, the council killed a\nmove to bring similar proceedings\nagainst The Milwaukee Electric Rail\nway and Light company.\u201d\nThe railway company has 13 inter\nurban lines running over the streets\nof Milwaukee, all of which are illegal\nbecausd they arc not established by\nfranchise.\nThe alacrity displayed by the rail\nroad commission in submitting the or\nder on interurban fares is in striking\ncontrast to the commission\u2019s stand on\nseveral matters of vital interest to\nthe people of Milwaukee.\nThe so-called 3-cent fare case took\nthe commission some five years to de\ncide and the end is not yet; action on\nthe rates of The Milwaukee Gas Light\ncompany required some two years and\nthen only th.? big consumers were\nbenefited; and telephone rates have\nnever been overhauled. It took years\nto secure track elevation orders, and\nthe commission has done nothing on\nwater rates following the recall of a\ntentative order raising the rates of\nthe small water users, which created\na city-wide protest.\nIt is also interesting to recall that\nit took the commission only about 30\ndays to order an' increase of power\nlighting rates when the Milwaukee\nElectric Railway company petitioned\nfor such after the Commonwealth\nPower company, a competitor,\ndropped its rates.\nKING ALCOHOL AGAIN\nLURES ONOE PROMINENT\nATTORNEY TO JAIL CELI\nMathew Riley, aged 61, once prom\ninent attorney and prohibition leader,\nwas arrested early Tuesday morning\non a charge of drunkehess.

He\nwas a gentleman combining the old and\nnew schools of ethics, surmounting pov\nerty and early disadvantages and fitting\nhimself for enlarged problems He ac\nquired a fund of information which\nplaced him in the front ranks of think\ners, readers and writers all worked out\nin a clear mir.d. In history, art and\ntravel, knowledge of the religions of\nthe world, he had few equals. He pos\nsessed the charitable, sympathetic and\nhelpful spirit to the fullest extent. His\nacquaintance at home ar.d throughout\nthe state was wide and of the best char\nacter.

John B. Densmore\nof the department of labor so an\nnounced after a final effort to bring\nthe warring interests together.\nHe did not hesitate to Marne his\nfailure upon the uncompromising at\ntitude of the mine owners, who re\nfused to recognize the Western Fed\neration of Miners as a party to arbi\ntration proceedings or other peace\nprojects.\nDensmore Tells Story.\n\u201cIn a nutshell, the question was\nwhether the union men should go back\nto work with or without discrimina\ntion. The companies refused to do\nanything but discriminate against\nmembers of the union,\u201d said Mr. Dens\nmore.\n\u201cIt means a struggle to the bitter\nend,\u201d said O. N. Hilton, chief of coun\nsel of the Western Federation of\nMiners, who has represented Presi\ndent C. H. Moyer here since the lat\nter\u2019s deportation. \u201cThe outcome is\ndue entirely to the attitude of the\ncompanies. They wanted everything\nand would concede nothing.\u201d\nCompromise Is Rejected.\nThe union\u2019s last word was an offer\nto withdraw the Western federation\nTom the field, its place to be taken by\n. union affiliated with the Michigan\nFederation of Labor, the United Mine\nWorkeis, with which the Western Fed\neration of Miners is affiliated, or some\nsimilar body. This was rejected ab\nsolutely by the companies.\nThe employing interest suggested to\nMr. Densmore that a secret vote of the\nmen on strike, if properly safeguard\ned, would show a majority of them in\nfavor of returning to work outside the\nunion fold. When this was broached\nto the federation men there was an\nimmediate declination to submit the\ncase to any such test.

Very much of this criticism\nis bad because it is unsound, untrue,\nand while objecting to tbe existing,\nhas nothing better to substitute. All\nof it is uDfortudate because it lowers\nthe value of a school education in the\nminds of unthinking people who need\nthe school the most. It is not at all\nunusual to find articles in any paper\nor magazine today bearing the title cf\nthis paragraph. Tbe following dis\ncussion which answers tbe question\nnegatively, written hy ,T. W. Red\nvay, is an extract from the Western\nTeacher\u201d for December.\n\u2018\u2018l take New York City as an\nexample. Knocking New York schools\nis quite tbe customary habit, and the\nsmall army of efficiency experts can\nfind nothing good about them.\nThree quarters of a million pupils\nattend them and about twenty\nthousand teachers constitute the\nteaching staff. Not far from one\nthird of tbe enrollment cousists of\npupils of foreign birth or are tbe\nchildren of foreign born parents.\nAt the present time the parents are\nmainly Italians, Russian Jews,\nSyrians, Poles, and Greeks They\nare the unskilled laborers and tbe\nvital energy of the sweat shops. So\nfar as tbe parents are concerned the\nproblem is simple. They will live a\nwhile, herded as sheep are herded,\nthen they die, But their children\nare the greatest problem on earth\ntoday. Let us see the work of the\nNew Y 7 ork schools un them, by a\nstudy of the past.\nFifty years ago the Irish formed\nthe chief factor in the unskilled\nlabor population. Walk along any\nbusiness street and one might be sure\nof seeing signs reading\u2014 \u2018Man wanted ;\nno Irish need apply. \u2019 Well, the\nadult generation lived and died; that\nwas all. Their children went to the\npublic scbcol. but they were never\nin any great proportion unskilled\nlaborers. The third generation of\nthese Irish immigrants is still living\nin New York City. Who are they,\nand what are they \u2019 The answer is\neasy : they are the greatest factor in\nthe political and industrial energy of\nthe state\u2014senators, congressman,\nengineers, contracture, clergymen,\neducators and railroad builders. And\nthe Jews of three generations ago?\nbankers, merchants, and capitalists.\nBoth nationalities are furnishmg tbe\nred blood of tbe country today.\nPardon another heresy ; the red blood\nis worth a lot more to the country\nthan the blue blood.\nNow it has been shown that if the\nhuman mind goes without training\nbetween the ages of six and twenty it\nceases to grow. Suppose that all these\nyouugsters of foreigD born parentage\nbad grown up without school train\ning. The answer to this is also easy ;\nthey would have been just what\ntheir grand parents were\u2014the flotsam\nand jetsam of civilization.\nIn the city of Mount Vernon. New\nYork, it costs about six hundred dol\nlars to steer a youngster through the\nelementary aud high schools The\naverage income of one hundred men\ngraduates of the high schol is not far\nfrom fifteen hundred dollars a year.\nAt five percent this is the income on\nthirty thousand dollars. Ia other\nwords, we invest six hundred dollars\nand tbe product commands just fifty\ntimes that sum What a failure!\u201d\nTHE WINTER SHORT COURSE\nMention was made in this column a\nshort time ago of the winter short\ncourses which were being introduced\nin a number of Wisconsin high\nschools this year. From the reports\nia the educational papers, the idea is\nnot wholly confined to this state.\nThe Geneseo, Illinois, Township High\nSchool has begun such a course for\ncountry boys. The course started\nDecember first with an enrollment of\ntwenty-four boys, ranging in age\nfrom fifteen to twenty years, and in\nadvancement, from the eighth grade\nto the third year of the high school.\nThe establishment of the course\nthere is the result of a definite de\nmand on the part of the farmer tax\npayers who have not been receiving\nthe benefits they tbiuk tbey ought to\nhave from the money they are pay\ning, because they need their boys for\nfall and spriug work on the farms.\nInquiries made by Principal Beatty\ndeveloped the fact that there were\nenough of the country boys interest\ned in the proposed coarse to warrant\nthe undertaking, hut it was not ex\npected that the enrollment for the\nfirst year would be more than twelve\nor fifteen.\nFive classes have been organized\nand each student is enrolled for four\nof the five; all but one are in the\nagriculture class.

Bennett.\nJohn H. Bennett was born in Corn\nwall, England, December 24, 1846.\nHe was brought to America with his\npaients when but six months old and\nlived with them in New York two\nyears. He had been a resident of\nSouthwestern Wisconsin forty years\u2014\ntwenty-seven of which he resided in\ntownship of Lancaster. At tbe\nMethodist parsonage in this city he\nwas married on January 1, 1873, to\nMiss Eliza C. Keretzer. Fonr chil\ndren came to bless their home, tbe\neldest, a sweet little girl of two and\none-half years, guing at that early\nage into the heavenly home. The\nonly other daughter, Mamie, in tbe\nbeauty of early womanhood died after\na lingering illness and mourned cf\nmany, April 7, 1908. Suddenly May\n26, 1913 while on a visit to tbe son\nPhil, wbb lived at Mather, this state,\ntbe beloved wife and mother took her\ndeparture for that land from whence\nnone return. Tbe dear body was\nbrought to Lancaster that it might\nrepose beside ber children. The bus\nband was broken hearted and would\nnot be comforted. He had been\ncrippled by disease and for many of\ntbe daily comforts of life was de\npendent upon the loving, faithful\nministries of his wife. None could\ntake her place. For some months be\nremained with his brother aDd sister,\nMr. and Mrs. Philip Beunett where\nhe received all the kindly attention\nthey could bestow. Then the son\nPhil came back to the tld borne in\nthis city where he and his wife tried\nto make tbe father comfortable aud\nhappy But he mourned incessantly,\nand prayed to be delivered of this life\nthat be might be reunited with his\nloved \u2018\u2018Eliza \u201d Existence tc bim\nwas only a burden without her com\npanionship Had he been strong and\nable bodied, he probably would have\ntaken up bis cross and borne it brave\nly as others do under irreparable\nlosses. In his decrepit state is it any\nwonder be so mourned so loyal a help\nmeet as Bennett was. The lov\ning Father noted his sorrow, and\nheeded tbe cry of bis heart. On the\nmorning of December 19, 1913, while\nsitting in bis chair with not a long\nwarning of his near approach, tbe\ndeath angel touched bim gently and\nhe passed peacefully away. Tbe sons\nGeorge us Mather and Phil of Lancas\nter, with their families other rela\ntives, and friends sorrow for their\nloss\u2014and yet rejoice that the parents\nwere not long divided. Rev.

These coats are made in\nthe regulation slip on style, from an\nintegral part of waterproof paper.\nTheir production cost will be no\nhigbtr than 5 cents each, and even\nthat figure can be lessened. The coat\ncan be folded np to fit in any ordinary\neuvelope and is particulary adapted\nto bring carried in bandoags\nThe coats can be made of oiled\npaper or paraffin, vellum parchment\npaper, which gives the appearance of\nsilkiness at a short distance. Tbe\noriginal idea was for the coats to be\nworn only once, but after a trial, it\nwas demonstrated tbat they could be\nutilized successfully two or three\ntimes. The coats are re-inforced\nwhere the buttons are sewed on and\nalso where the button holes are cut.\nThere are only two seams, both\nrunning underneath tbe arms and\ndown the sides.

Lei\nserson, superintendent free employ\nment department, says that the labor\ncamps of the state are a menace to\nthe health of the public.\nLeiserson has just completed an in\nvestigation of the various labor camps\nof the state, including- the lumber,\nrailroad, ice, dock, paper mill, can\nning and several minor industries.\nHis in vestigations brought to light re\nsults which will prove a surprise not\nonly to the public, but perhaps even\nto the men engaged in the various in\ndustries inspected.\nWhile Wisconsin conditions are\nbad, Leiserson says that according to\nthe men who live in labor camps they\nare much better than in other states\nin the Union.\nThe ice at.a lumber industries he\nfound to be by far the worst, except\ning one rare instance\u2014a camp for\ndock laborers at Superior known as\nthe \u201cB igaboo,\u201d which outclassed any\nplace visited. This was the object\nof a newspaper expose about a year\nago.\nWhat Inspector Found.\nHere is what Leiserson found:\nFifty thousand men living in Wis\nconsin labor camps.\nTwenty thousand working in the\nlumber camps.\nTwenty thousand working in the\nrailroad camps.\nFive thousand in ice field barracks.\nFive thousand in miscellaneous\ncamps and canning factories.\nIn the lumber camps he found food\ngood, but sleeping conditions, except\nin rare instances, exceedingly bad.\nKitchens generally clean, but bunk\ning quarters are dirty, filthy, uncared\nfor and insanitary.\nRailroad camps divided into two\nclasses \u2014\u201cwhite men's and toreign\ners\u2019 camps.\u201d\nForeigners\u2019 camps are run by the\nmen themselves, the railroad com\npanies furnishing cars equipped with\nstoves for cooking. Bunks are planked\noff on both .ends of the car. the un\nder space being used for storing pro\nvisions and often fuel and clothes.\n\u201cWhite men\u2019s camps,\u201d conducted by\ncontractors who board men for stat\ned prices, usually consist of coal car,\nkitchen, dining car and bunking cars.\nNo attempt at sanitation. In the\nsummer flies and insects swarm the\nkitchen and other cars.\nThe cook usually sleeps in the\nkitchen, seldom even screening the\nbunk from the remainder of the car.\nThe helper was found, in several in\nstances, to make his bed on the kitch\nen or dining tables. The bunk cars\ncontain from 6 to 8 upper and lower\nbunks, housing from 12 to 16 men.\nFood Is Poor.\nFood is poor, with the blame put on\nthe cooks for the worst conditions by\nthe contractors. Men get one or two\nlight blankets and straw mattress, but\nno pillows.\nBy far the worst conditions were\nfound in the barracks in the ice fields.\nMen are forced to take jobs at this\ntime of the year for what they ca-n\nget, to accept conditions as they are,\nwork being scarce and the men gen\nerally being without employment and\nin sore need.\nOld farm houses are used for hous\ning purposes, places intended orig\ninally for use only for family pur\nposes. In several cases they are\ntumble down structures, deserted by\nthe former owners, rotten and of little\nuse. Repaired, filled with bunks and\nequipped with kitchen and dining ta\nbles, they must serve for the ice\nworkers. In two instances model\nbarracks were found.\nBoard is about on a par with the\nrailroad camps. The men receive\nfrom 15 to 17% cents an hour, the\nsame as for several years past. Board\nhas increased, however, from $3 to\n$4.50 per week.\nLeiserson states in his report that\nthere is little regard paid to sanitary\nconditions in any of the camps; that\nthey are naturally breeding places for\ndisease, and there is little or no at\ntempt made to keep down sickness\namong the men.\nXo Doctors for Men.\nHe says they are permitted to leave\nthe camps even when sick without\nany precautions for the safety of the\npublic at large, often without any\nmedical attendance for the men.\nThey go into the cities where they\nlive in cheap boarding houses, among\nhundreds of men, are permitted to\nleave the camps whui sick, riding in\nrailroad trains exposing entire com\nmunities to the disease.\nOf 15 cities investigate 1 where men\ncongregate from labor camps hospi\ntal records showed the following cases\ndirectly traceable to the camps: Ty\nphoid, 159 cases; smallpox, 12; diph\ntheria, 6; other communicable dis\neases, 28. Most of the known cases\ncame from the lumber camps because\nof the better records kej.t of men\nfrom the woods. Railroad camps\nfurnished ihe next largest number.\n\u2666\n4> 4>\n4> THE WEATHER.\nCloudy tonight i nd Thursday; <s>\n\u2022 moderate temperature 4-\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 * \u2022 *", "batch": "whi_cheddar_ver01", "title_normal": "milwaukee leader.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045293/1914-01-07/ed-1/seq-1.json", "place": ["Wisconsin--Milwaukee--Milwaukee"], "page": ""}, {"sequence": 1, "county": ["Wood"], "edition": null, "frequency": "Weekly", "id": "/lccn/sn85033078/1914-01-08/ed-1/seq-1/", "subject": ["Wisconsin Rapids (Wis.)--Newspapers.", "Wisconsin--Wisconsin Rapids.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01224880"], "city": ["Wisconsin Rapids"], "date": "19140108", "title": "Wood County reporter.

A mystery\nsurrounds the affair as it is not\nknown who did the shooting. It is\nthought that whoever fired the\nshot, was either trying to kill Mr.\nLoock\u2019s dog or mistook it for a\nTa'bbit. The dog was close to Mr.\nLoock's right leg when the shot was\nfired. The dog was killed and part\nof the charge entered the right leg,\nankle and foot of Loock.

Found In Home of\nFriend by Officers.\nThe attempt of Elizabeth Hensehel,\nfifteen years old, to commit suicide,\ncaused a great deal of excitement in\nthe fourth ward Saturday evening.\nMiss Hensehel left home about six\no\u2019clock Saturday evening, because\nshe fea-ed her father. She had stated\nfollowing a beating he had given her\non a previous occasion, that if he\never beat her again she would kill\nherself. She went to the river and\nattempted to get into deep water,\nbut was unsuccessful and finally gave\nit up and wandered to the house of\na friend where she was taken care\nof and afterward found by the offi\ncers.\nAccording to the story told by the\ngirl and the officers, she intended\nto drown herself, hut because of the\nshallow water and ice she did not\nsucceed. It is said that several\nweeks ago her father gave her a\nsevere beating and she made the\nstatement that she would kill her\nself if he ever beat her again. Sat\nurday evening Hensehel learned that\nshe had been to a moving picture\nshow and began to raise a row. The\ngirl fled from the house. Officer\nBanter and Undersheriff Bluett were\nsent for and took up the hunt for the\nmissing girl. She was traced to the\nriver and the place where she| start\ned out on the ice was discovered\nSearch along the hank showed where\nshe had come back to shore. The of\nficers agreed that she had probably\nbeen unable to get to deep water\nand had returned to shore and was\nin the home of some friend. A sys\ntematic search of all the houses in\nthe neighborhood was commenced.\nThe officers were not saitsfied with\nthe verbal denial of the people but\ninsisted upon searching the houses.\nThe girl was finally found at the\nhome of Emil Toeple on Burt street.\nMr. and Mrs. Toeple took the girl\nin and had put her to bed under\nwarm blankets. It was after eleven\no\u2019clock before the sdhrch was over.\nThe father finally arrived and got\nclothing for the girl and took her\nback to her home.\nDISCUSS WORK\nOF CIRCUIT COURT\nSay Double Trial System Should\nBe Abolished.\nThe circuit judges of the state\nhave been in session at Madison,\nwith the committee of lawyers ap\npointed at the last session of the\nlegislature to investigate court sys\ntems.\nThat the double trial system in\nprobate matter\u00ae is a drag on the\ncourts and should be abolished, was\none of the decisions reached. Judge\nA. H. Reid of Wausau and others\ndeclared there should be either an\nappeal from county court to .supreme\ncourt or else, when an issue is. join\ned in probate court, that the matter\nbe certified to circuit court for\ntrial.\nThere w r as considerable discussion\nover the proposed abolition of the\noffice of justice of the peace, but\nno decision was reached.\nThis was the first meeting of the\nlegislative committee since appoint\nment. It will report to the next leg\nislature the result of the investiga\ntion and submit a plan that appears\nto best suit the state needs and\nmeet with the approval of the state\njudiciary.\nMonday evening the circuit judges\nwere entertained at a banquet at\nwhich Judge W. J. Turner of Milwau\nkee, spoke of the divorce evil. He\nsaid that probably 5d per cent of the\ndivorces in Milwaukee county might\nhe avoided if anew system of grant\ning divorces was devised. Judge\nTurner believes that the legislature\nshould pass a law creating the posi\ntion of divorce lawyer to be appoint\ned by the circuit judge and no divorc\naction could be brought, except bj\nthis mam. \u201cI think,\u2019\u2019 said Judge\nTurner, \u201cthat there are a large\nnumber of divorces brought b> law\nvers\u2019 runners, who have brought out\nan evil as great as the ambulance\nchaser in personal injury cases. Then\ntoo. divorced women often urge wo\nmen who have had a quarrel to get\na lawyer and get a divorce. These\nremarks were made in refernece to\nMilwaukee county cases. Judge Turn\ner said he did not believe that the\nsame conditions prevailed in every\ncounty of the state.\nENDORSES SENATOR HATTON\nThe Eagle-Star is glad to note that\nWilliam H. Hatton of New London,\nis an announced candidate for the\nRepublican gubernatorial nomination.\nWe have contended for months that\nhe was the key to the situation for\nthe Republicans of Wisconsin. No\nother man, so far mentioned, com\nbines all the qualities necessary in\na candidate for the chief executive\nship, as he does. The Republicans of\nWisconsin have before them the big\ngest state fight of two decades. The\nstate situation, a Democratic presi\ndent in the chair, favor the opposi\ntion and it will need all the resources\nof a united Republican party to carry\nthe next state election. Mr. Hatton\nwill unite the parties as no other\nman can and is an ideal man for\nthe Then why not do\nthe logical thing. Republicans, and\nnominate him?\u2014Marinette Eagle-Star\nMOTOR NUMBERS\nCO OUTOF STILE\nNew Number Plates of a Better\nDesign\nMOTORIST TO BE GIVEN TIME\nState is Unable to Provide Applicants\nWith License Numbers \u2014Sorpe\nNew Numbers Here.\nRaus mat the 1913 automobile num\nbers. They went out of date at mid\nnight Wednesday, That was the last\nsecond that the 1913 licenses were\ngood. A few Grand Rapids automo\nbile owners already have their new\nnumbers. Those who have declare\nthat they are an improvement over\nthe 1913 numbers, because they are\nof better make-up and are more dis\ntinguishable.\nThe 1914 number plates are made\nfrom one piece of sheet steel, the\nnumber being pressed into relief in\nstead of tacked on as they wqre\nin 1913. The background of the num\nber plate is ena.maled white and the\nnumbers are enameled black, conse\nquently the Wisconsin number plate\nhave about all the contrast colors\nwill permit.\nThe new numbers are slightly\nwider than the \u00a7ld onesi, and the fact\nthat they are pressed from the steel\nplate instead of tacked on to it will\nmake it easier for motorists to keep\nt v -cl 0 ? -'V fl .ip e&jbi q s-ha l^ \u25a0\nNo one will be arrested: if he de\nports himself on country roads or\ncity streets with the 1913 number\nplate attached. The state department\nis so swamped with applications for\nnew numbers that it is impossible to\nissue new numbers fast enough. The\nfact that there are more automobiles\nin service this winter than ever be\nfore has only served to increase the\nrush of applicants.\nThe law, leisurely interpreted, give\nmotorists time enough to get their\nnumbers and run with the old ones\non until they do, because the state\nknows that before very much time\nelapses new numbers will be procur\ned. So apply for new numbers and\ndrive with the old ones until the\nstate sends you the new black and\nwhit\u00a9 figures.\nTWO APPOINTED\nOK COUNTY JUDGE\nSoldier.s Relief Committee Now\nComplete Again.\nThe vacancies on the Soldiers\u2019\nRelief Committee have been filled\nby County Judge - W.

In this section we have\nheard of but few sufferers. One un\nfortunate fellow, residing in Brown\ncounty, had both his feet frozen so\nbadly that it was at first supposed he\ncould not live, but through the skill\nful efforts of Dr. Balcom, ho is in k\nfair way to recover, though amputation\nof one of the limbs was found to be\nnecessary.\nA Large Establishment \u2014 Mr.\nWilliam liabr, the well known Brewer\nhas just completed a very large estab\nlishment for the manufacture of lager\nbeer, and at his invitation many of our\ncitizens visited his cellar on Saturday\nlast.

Vet\nthese are the very places most in need\nof it. In the larger centers competent\ndoctors are available, and in the cities\nfree medical and dental clinics may al\nways be found, but in the country med\nical and dental attention is often diffi\ncult to obtain.\nAgain, people in the country are\nlittle inclined to seek aid from physic\nians or dentists, simply because they\nhave not yet been educaflAi to do so\nexcept in serious cases. It therefore\nhappens that children of the rural\nschools are in general (contrary to the\ngeneral impression) more in need of\nmedical and dental attention than the\nchildren of larger communities.\nThere is also a common impression\nthat country children are naturally\nmore vigorous than city children.\nr i his ought to bo true, but unfortun\nately it is not. In general food is not\nas well prepared in the country as it\nis in the city; the available variety is\nsmaller; the houses and schools are\nless well ventilated, overheating in\nwinter is common; tuberculosis is not\nso well understood and the chances for\n\u201chouse infection\u201d are therefore great\ner; and general public sanitation is\nalmost without exception neglected in\nthe country.\nChildren in the country are more ex\nposed to unfavorable weather condi\ntions than are city children. They of\nten walk long distances in extreme\nheat, cold, or wet; and sit in school\nwith damp clothing or wet feet. They\nalmost invariably wear 100 much cloth\ning indoors in cold weather, and are\nconsequently overheated in the school\nroom and then are chilled on the way\nhome. Under such conditions it is no\nwonder that colds and other respira\ntory disorders are common, and that\nmany country children are out of\nschool on account of various kinds of\nsickness\nTin sanitation of a rural school is\nusually very bad. The common drink\ning cup hangs from a nail over the\nwater pail; floors and desks are often\nvery dirty; ventilation is a negligible\nquantity; outdoor toilets are in un\nspeakable condition; washing facilities\nare either not provided at all, or con\nsist of a pail of water, a dirty tin basin,\nand one common towel.- From U, S.\nliureau of Kducation Letter.\nThe above letter needs to be heeded\nat this time of the year. There is\nmuch sickness throughout the county\nand city. Several schools were closed\nbefore the holidays. School boards\ncannot give the matter of fumigation\ntoo much attention at this time. The\nschool house ought to disinfected fre\nquently now. Some children catch\ndiseases from each other very readily.\nTake alt necessary precaution, it is\ncheaper than paying doctor bills, and\nmay prevent an epidemic in the com\nmunity.\nBl) v LAND ON EASY TEHMS.\nCut over hard wood lands in Wiscon\nsin, from 915.00 per acre up. 91 00 per\nacre cash, balance in monthly install\nments of 9. r j.oo on each forty (.ought.\nNo better proiswltion known.

Rooney of Chicago, who has\ninterested himself in the municipal\nChristmas tree plans has sent a letter\nto Mayor Head offering to donate to\nthe city of Kenosha a great pine tree\nto be planted somewhere in the city\nand to be used as a perpetual Christmas\ntree. Rooney furnished the municipal\ntree to Chicago this year. The proposi\ntion is that he will ship the tree to Ke\u2018-\nnosha with the soil frozen about the\nroots and he holds that if it is planted\nunder such conditions that the transfer\nof it from the northern forests to Ke\nnosha will in no way retard its growth.\nRooney plans to ship trees to seventy\ncities in Illinois, Indiana and Wiscon\nsin.\nMayor Head declared today that he\nwas favorable to the proposition and he\nsuggested that the tree be secured and\nset up in the Market Square Park at\nthe intersection of Church street\nSTARTS ON 810 TASK\nMayor Head Busy Investi\ngating Petitions Asking\nFor Commission Form.\nSMALL MARGIN TO WORK ON\nI\nMayor Declares That He Wil. 1 Rush the\nWork of Investigation and Is\u00bb,.t For\nmal Proclamation Just as Soon as Ha\nIs Satisfied With the Petitions.\nMayor Dan 0. Head has started the\narduous task of checking up the names\non the petitions demanding a referen\ndum on the commission form of govern\nment. At the last general election in\nthe city there were 4,010 votes cast for\nall the candidates for mayor and in or\nder to have the question of the com\nmission form submitted to the people\nthe petitions now in the hands of the\nmayor must contain the names of 1,010\nqualified electors of tne city of Keno\nsha. The petitions contain exactly\n1,027 names so that the margin is but\nseventeen and it is probably that this\nwill be reducted by the elimination of\nduplicate signatures. Mayor Head will\nprobably he abb to complete the ex\namination of the names on the petition\nwithin two weeks and if he is satisfied\nthat the number is sufficient he will\nlose no time in issuing his proclama\ntion. Under the law the election must\nbe held within sixty days after the\npresentation of the petition and the\nproclamation of the mayor must be is\nsued within thirty days in order to\ngive time for the preliminaries to the\nprimary.\nThe law provides that should the com\nmission form be adopted by the refer\nendum vote that the candidates for\nmayor and for councilmen must be\nnominated at a regular primary elec\ntion. This primary is to be held under\nthe law which has governed city pri\nmaries in the past. The candidates\nmust silo affidavits of their candidacy\nat least twenty days before the date\nset for the primary and the affidavits\nmust be accompanied by a petition\nsigned by at least twenty-five electors.\nAll petitions must be circulated at\nlarge and under the commission form\nward lines will be entirely w : ped out.\nSome of the opponents to the com\nmission form lave insisted already that\nthe petition is insufficient, they holding\nthat the law demands that the petition\nbe signed by one-fourth of the number\nof electors who voted at the last gen\neral election. T' iy hold that many\nvotes were cast blank for the office of\nmayor and that the total number of\nall the votes cast was largely in\nexcess of the number received by the\nthree actual candidates. The reading\nof the law appears to be plain and it\nstates that the petitions shall be sign\ned by twenty-five per cent of the votes\ncast for all candidates for mayor. No\nmention of the blank votes is made in\nthe law. This matter has been referred\nto the \u00abcity attorney for a decision.\nThe clans have already begun to line\nup for and against the proposed change\nin the form of government of the city.\nMany of the workingmen of the city\nseem to be committed to the new form\nand it has a large support among the\nheavier tax payers of the city. The\nplan is opposed by the men who have\nbeen active in politics as these men\n, seem to prefer the old form.\n\u201cIt will take a long while to get\nover these petitions,\u201d said Mayor Head\nin discussing the matter. \u201cThere are\na lot of names on them that I have\nnever heard of and I shall be forced\nto refer to poll lists i 1 order to satis\nfy myself that the petitions contain the\nrequisite number of electors. Just as\nsoon as I am convinced that this is true\nI will make the proclamation provided\nby the state law.\u201d\nONE MAN RELEASED.\nJulius Elbi Arrested on Charge of Aid\ning Fugitive Released on Tuesday.\nJulius Elbi, one of the Italians ar\nrested on Monday night on charges of\nhaving aided in the escape of Peter\nCovalla, who was charged with attempt\ned murder, was released on Tuesday\nnight at the order of District Attorney\nAL. Drury. The district attorney held\n; that the evidence was not sufficient to\nhold Elbi for a preliminary hearing in\nthe municipal court. This morning a\nformal complaint was issued for the ar\nrest of James Jendi, who is charged\nwith having furnished the money to\nCovalla to go to Italy.

JANUARY 8, 1914.\nSHOWS BIG INCREASE\nPostal Receipts of Kenosha\nPostoffice Jump $15,000 in\nthe Year of 1913.\nANNUAL HEPOfIT ISSUED TODAY\nPostmaster and Assistants Are Hopeful\nThat Kenosha Wid Supplant Green\nBay as Sixth in List of Postoffices in\nWisconsin in the Annual Report.\nAssistant Postmaster Michael F.\nZeus today .issued his annual report of\nthe receipts of the Kenosha postoffi.ee\nin the sale of stamps and this report\nshows that the year 1913 brought a re\ncord increase in the business of the\nKenosha postoffice. So great is the in\ncrease that the officials of the local of\nfice are of the opinion and entertain\nhigh hopes that Kenosha will supplant\nGreen Bay as the sixth office in the\nstate in the matter of stamp sales.\nKenosha jumped over Sheboygan in the\nreport made by Postmaster Welch of\nEau Claire, a year ago, and it is expect\ned that the statistics of the state ofiices\nto be issued some time this month will\ngive Kenosha another boost. This will\nmake it sixth with Oshkosh fifth\nand Oshkosh is so far ahead of Keno\nsha that it is feared that it will be\nseveral years before the Kenosha office\ntakes an upward step in the list of the\noffices of the state.\nThe increase in the postal receipts\nof the local office over the receipts in\n1912 is more than fifteen thousand dol\nlars, the largest increase ever showm in\nan annual report. The business of the\nparcel post system is reflected in this\nyear's business, but at that the busi\nness of the office for December is only\n$450 greater than the bigness of the\npreceding year. \u2022 I!LL-the fir#\nten thousand dollar month in the sale\nof stamps in the Kenosha office, the re\nceipts for the month of May passing\nthe ten thousand mark and being more\nthan $3,000 greater than the receipts in\nthe same month last year.\nThe report sent out this year com\npares the receipts of the office over a\nterm of eleven years. It shows that in\n1902 the receipts of the office (postal)\nwere $22,627.88, considerably less than\none-fourth of the receipts during the\nyear just closed. In 1907 the receipts\nhad jumped to $48,996.67; in 1910 they\nreached $63,855.69; in 1911, $75,361.42;\nin 1912, $83,503.38, and in 1913,\n$98,815.86.\nIt will be noted that the increase in\nthe sales for the last year was within\nseven thousand dollars of the increase\nin the five years from 1902 to 1907.\nThe monthly sales of stamps for 1913,\nas compared with 1912, are as follows:\n1912. 1913.\nJanuary $ 7,338.85 $ 8.591.51\nFebruary 5,518.16 7,244.83\nMarch 8,057.43 9,143.30\nApril 6,155.74 9,208,27\nMay 7,026.72 10,189.08\nJune 5,715.59 7,575.21\nJuly 6,812.44 7,768.93\nAugust 7,074.47 6,564.30\nSeptember 6,443.15 8,272.42\nOctober 7,168.76 7,339.26\nNovember 6,439.95 7,016.36\nDecember 9,455.12 9,905.39\nTotals $83,503.38 $98,815.86\nMUST CARE FOR HYDRANTS.\nWater Commission Would Put Fire Pro\ntection in Charge of Department.\nThe water commission at its regular\nsession on Tuesday night took steps to\nput all work in connection with the\nmaintenance of the fire hydrants under\nthe charge of the chief of the fire de\npartment. In order to make this pos\nsible the commission ds planning to in\nstall special taps, which may be used\nby patrons having contracts for street\nsprinkling and after these taps are put\nin the street sprinklers will not be per\nmitted to take water from the fire\nhydrants under any consideration. The\nmembers of the commission spent more,\nthan an hour discussing filtration plans\nbut nothing of a definite nature was\ndone. The commission expects to have\nits report on the proposed filtration\nplant ready for submission to the coun\ncil either at the next regular meet\ning or at the first meeting of the coun\ncil in February.\nSTORE CLOSED.\nOur store will be closed all day Fri\nday to mark down the entire stock for\nour big clearing sale which opens Sat\nurday, 9 a. m.\nj\u00dfdwadv S. & J.

F. Bidin\nger and Postmaster Daniel Grady came\nto Kenosha to be the guests of the\nKenosha Council. They came on a spe\ncial car and they came prepared to\ntake charge of all the proceedings of\nthe evening and when they marched in\nto the council hall the officers of the\nKenosha Council yielded their chairs\nto the visitors and all that the Kenosha\nmembers had to do was to spread the\nglad hand and accept the splendid en\ntertainment provided by the visiting\nknights.\nThe Waukegan team had charge of\nthe regular meeting of tht, council and\nafter the work was completefl Mayor\nBidinger was introduced as master of\nceremonies and for an hour the visit\ning knights put on an entertainment\nthat made the Kenosha members of the\norder sit up and take notice.\nThere were musical numbers and\nvaudeville stunts furnished by the vis\nitors and there were addresses breach\ning fraternal greetings by the Wauke\ngan mayor. Postmaster Grady, Louis\nDurkin, John Broderick. John Reardon\nand James Gallagher. Every one of the\nsp<nkcrs had to say. The\nWaukegan visitors urged a closer rela\ntionship between the members of the\norder in Kenosha and Waukegan, and\nspoke of the common interest of all in\nthe advancement of the Work of the\nKnights of Columbus. There were\ntoasts to the order and to its work in\ntwo of the great states in the union.\nAfter the Waukegan men had sang\nand talked themselves tired the Keno\nsha members showed that they were not\nlacking in hospitality and led the way\nto rhe banquet hall where a dinner was\nserved at which covers were laid for\nmore than 150. After dinner was over\nthere was more talking and more good\nfellowship. The members of the Ke\nnosha Council accepted an invitation to\nhave charge of the next meeting of the\nWaukegan Council, and an effort will\nbe made to have at least a hundred\nKenosha knights visit Waukegan on\nthat occasion.\nThis promises to be a banner year\nfor the Kenosha Council and already\nmore than forty applications have been\nreceived. It is planned to arrange for\nthe initiation of a class of more than\n60 members in about two months and\nthis class initiation will be made the\noccasion of one of the biggest gather\nings ever held by the Kenosha Council.\nBIG SUIT IS SETTLED.\nSIO,OOO Suit Brought by Angelo Copen\nAgainst Brass Co. Dismissed Today.\nIn the municipal cpurt this morning\nJudge Randall handed down a formal\norder dismissing the suit brought by\nAngelo Copen against the Chicago Brass\ncompany in which the plaintiff had de\nmanded damages to the amount of $lO,-\n000. The order for dismissal of the sun\nwas based on a stipulation of the at\ntorneys in the case which indicated\nthat the case had been settled out of\ncourt, but no facts in regard to the na\nture of the settlement were made pub\nlic. The attorneys for the defendant\ncompany had filed a demurrer demand\ning the dismissal of the action and the\nmotion was under consideration by the\ncourt when the notice of settlement\nwas received. Copen lost an eye in an\naccident at the plant of the company\nsome time ago.\nOUTSIDERS SEEKING JOBS.\nWorkmen Coming From Other Cities to\nTake Advantage of Prosperity.\nSpeaking in regard to the number of\nmen out of employment in the city, tba \\\nmanager of the Manufacturers\u2019 Em\nployment bureau makes the statement\nthat out-of-town applicants are coming\nin much faster than they can be placed.\nDuring the first two days of the present\nweek the bureau received applications;\nfrom forty-two machinists, thirty'\nwoodworkers, sixteen painters, besides\nnumerous other tradesmen. AH this\ngoes to show that the crowded condi- \u25a0\ntion.of the labor market is due more\u2019\nto the influx of outside mechanics than i\nL to idle people al home. t\nSEEK REBATE RELEASES.\nCity Attorney Draws Formal Release\nfor Market Square Paving Rebates.\nThe city officials are planning to ef\nfect an early settlement of the question\nof the payment of rebates for paving\non the south side of Market Square by\nthe, railway company and City Attorney\nSlater is bow drawing releases to be\nsigned by each of the property owners.\nThe city has agreed to pay to the prop\nerty owners one-half of the amount re\nbated by the company. It is claimed\nthat every property owner on the south\nside of the square with a single excep\ntion has agreed to sign the release.\nThe exception will probably be taken\ncare,of by the railway company.

M. DeDeimar, clerk of the circuit\ncourt of Kenosha county and in charge\nof all naturalization work in this\ncounty, has received the following\nwarning from the department at Wash\nington. It is said that the book re\nferred to in the letter has had a wide\ncirculation io this city and county.\nTo Chief Naturalization Examiners.\nExaminers, Officers of the Naturali\nzation Service, Clerks of Courts ex\nercising jurisdiction in naturalization\nmatters, and others concerned.\nIt has been brought to the attention\nof the department that a publication\nentitled \u201cSyllabus-Digest of Decisions\nUnder the Law of Naturalization of\nthe United States,\u201d purporting to be\nthe work of Jerome C.

He de\nclares that to get the greatest ef\n| ficiency from the splendid apparatus\ni provided by the city that more men\n\u25a0 are necessary. He seeks to have added\nj men at each of the stations and men\nlto take care of a new station to ba\nbuilt next summer if possible. In addi\ntion to this the chief declares that the\nrebuilding of the fire alarm system is<\n! now a necessity. He holds that during\nI the year alarms have failed to come ini\non account of the condition of the ap\ni paratus at the city hall. His sugges\ntion is that the system be divided into\nsix circuits in order to make it easier\nto locate the breaks. At the present\ntime there are but two circuits. He sug\ngests the installation of a six circuit*\ni repeater and the exchanging nf the\nI nresent two circuit switch board for anj\nj C'ght circtl L . board. JSit'h changes\n\u2022Auld no s <J; ,v f or |]j e\ndiate demands of the department, but'\nalso for the future. He asks that the\ncity provine at once for the installation!\nof eight new fire alarm boxes. The\u2019\ncouncil has already taken up the ques\ntion of the erection of a new station 1\non West Grand avenue and the mem\nbers of the council are divided as to\nthe necessity of such an expenditure at\nthis time but it is not improbable that*\nthe new house will be ordered before 1\nthe end of the present year. No ap\n' propriation has leen made for the erec-\nI tion of the horse in the annual budget\ni of the citv. tut this is not a bar to the\nbuilding of the house as there was no\nappropriation made for the new build*\ning in the third ward recently com\ni pleted.\nThe annual report of the chief con\ntains a lot of interesting statistics. It\nshows that the value of apparatus own\ned by the city for fire purposes is well\nover $25,000 and that Kenosha has the\nonly complete motor fire service to be\nfound in the state of Wisconsin. The\nreal estate and buildings owned by the\ncity and used for the fire department\nare value at $50,000. The report shows\nthat during the year the department was\ncalled out ninety-nine times and of this\nnumber of calls but twenty were box\ncalls. The total loss on buildings and\nstocks during the year amounted to\n$8,820 and this loss was covered by an.\ninsurance of many times its amount.\nThe majority of the fires attended dur\ning the year were small blazes in which\nthe loss was less than SSO and the larg\nest loss reported was $2,000. This loss\u2019\nwas entirely covered by insurance.\nThe financial report is interesting.\nIt shows thai the cost of maintenance\nof the department for the year was\n$29,946.47. Of this amount $14,712.52\nwas paid out in salaries to the members\nof the department and $7,518.65 was\nexpended for real estate and buildings.\nThe expenses for apparatus during the\nfiscal year amounted to $4,861.74, this\nbeing the amount paid for new appara\ntus after deducting the amounts re\nalized by the city by sale of old;\napparatus.\nIn his report the chief pays high tri\nbute to the work of the men under him,'\ndeclaring that they have at all times\nbeen faithful to their duties and that\nthey have rendered most efficient\u2019\nservice to the city.\nThe recommendations of the chief\nwill be taken up at an early meeting\nof the council.\nThe jury which heard the ei iilenee ia\nthe suit of John Stocker vs. Adam Win\ntieski and others, reached a verdict late\non Tuesday afternoon finding for the\nplaintiff and fixing the amount he should\nrecover at $65.25.\nThe Kenosha and Racinr high school\nbasketball teams will clash in the first\ngame of the season in Racine on Friday\nevening.

In\nden Buchten von EanneS und Antivcs\nsowie vor der M\u00fcndung des Var sin\nden sich untermeerische Quellen, die\nsich bei ruhiger See durch Aufwallen\nverraten. Auch in der Umgebung r\nRhonem\u00fcnduiigkn treten submarine\nQuellen und oft in beir\u00e4ckttichec\nTiefe auf. Die m\u00e4chtigste ist die von\nPort Miou bei Cassis, sie bricht aus\neinem der 2 Quadratmeter gro\u00dfen\nFelsentore mit solcher Gewalt hervor,\nda\u00df sie an der Mccresorft\u00e4che einen\nStrom hervorruft, der schwimmende\nGegenst\u00e4nde oft \u00fcber 2 Kilometer weit\nforttreibt.

In der N\u00e4he der\nInsel Saba in den Kleinen Antillen\nwurde mitten im Meer das Vorhan\ndensein einer bedeutenden S\u00fc\u00dfwasser\nmasse entdeckt, die in konzentrischen\nKreisen vom Meeresboden aufzuquel\nlen schien.

Villa immediately took per\nsonal charge of the command and in\ndicated that he would order the at\ntack on Ojinaga resumed before\nnight. With his own and Herrera\u2019s\ntroops and those under Ortega, Villa\nwill have 9,000 soldiers.\nThis should be sufficient to over\nwhelm the federal garrison now\ncooped up in Ojinaga or waiting in the\ntrenches at the base of the hill on\nwhich the town is situated.\nThe presence of Villa has inspired\nthe rebel army with renewed confi\ndence and some of the high officers\npredicted that they would dine in\nOjinaga Saturday night.\nk Despite the overwhelmingly supe\nrior force of the enemy, the 4,000\nfederal defenders of Ojinaga are far\nfront discouraged. Their victory in\nthe recent eight days\u2019 battle has given\nthem new courage and Gen.

All the >\nothers are closed and all the strike '\nbreakers available from all the other\nmines have been brought to these two\nto make a showing,\u201d said Victor L.\nBerger, on his return Friday morning \u2019\nfrom the copper strike region, where i\nhe went with Charles Edward Russell\nand Seymour Stedman, as an investi- j\ngating committee of the Socialist i\nparts'.\n\u201cThe miners declare they have \u0964\n8,000 men still out and that if they !\ncan get money to keep them they can I\nwin the strike. It will take SBO,OOO a i\nmonth to support the strikers, and the\norganized laborers of the United\nStates ought to be able to furnish this\nfor the few weeks that will be neces\nsary to win.\n\u201cFeeling there is extremely bitter.\nDuring the 50 years that the mines\nhave been operated there has never\nbeen a. union until recently. The\nmine owners have drawn out fabulous\nprofits year after year, and naturally\nthey wished to continue to do this.\nWar on Unions.\n\u201cWhen the Finns went into the\nmines in large numbers they organ\nized a local union, and soon affiliated\nit with the Western Federation of I\nMiners. At once the mine owners be\ngan to play upon the prejudice against\nthat organization and to victimize\nevery person suspected of member\nship. This forced a strike before the\nmen were really ready for it, but\nthere was no alternative.\n\u201cAt first the little middle class was\nsympathetic with the strikers. Then\nmembers of the Western Federation of\nMiners began to buy their supplies at j\nwholesale and to distribute them with- i\nout giving a profit to the little store- i\nkeepers. That turned the tide. These\nmerchants cried out that they would\nbe ruined, and demanded that the\nstrike be stopped and the W. F. of M.\nbe stamped out. Then came the Citi- i\nzens\u2019 alliance and the violence against\nthe strikers.\nDuplicates Colorado Facts.\n\u201cThis is simply a duplication of the\nsame facts that caused the same re\nsults in Colorado, where the co-opera\ntive stores were wrecked, the miners\nassaulted and deported and a reign of\nviolence kept up by the Citizens\u2019 alli\nance.\n\u201cThere is a lot of hypocrisy talked\nby the Citizens\u2019 alliance crowd. They\nclaim they are in favor of unions, but\nnot of the Western Federation of\nMiners. Of course, they all know that\nno other union exists in the metaliffer\nous industries. So this simply means\nthat they are in favor of unions in\nthe breweries and the cotton mills, but\nnot in the mines.\n\u201cGov. Ferris is a radical, who told\nme he was a single taxer, had read all\nmy speeches and a number of Socialist\nbooks. He has worked out a sort of\nanarchist, single tax philosophy by\nwhich he* excuses himself from taking\nany action, on the ground that he does\nnot want to use force.\n\u201cI made three proposals to him.\nFirst, I suggested that he withdraw\nthe militia and send out the armed\nguards (1,600 of these are now em\nployed in Houghton county' alone), all\npaid by the mining companies and not\nby the county, and simply a private\narmy. Second, I urged that he in\nstruct his district attorney to take\nsteps to prevent the eviction of the\nminers, and third, that he provide\nagainst the misery now being endured\nby granting state relief to the miners.\nEvades Direct Issue.\n\u201cHis only reply was that this would\nbe confiscation.\n\u201cSeymour Stedman then suggested\nthat he furnish militia tents for the\nminers who will be evicted. This he\nalso refused to do, saying that he had\nno legal right to do this.\n\u201cCharles Edward Russell asked him\nwhy he could not at least request the\nmine owners to recognize and deal\nwith the Western Federation of Min\ners, and he simply said he would not\ndo anything of the kind.\n\u201cThere is a strange nationality di\nvision in the strike. Nearly every\nstrike breaker is a Cornishman or\n\u2018Cousin Jack,\u2019 as they are called in the\nmines. The Finns, South Slavonians,\nItalians and other nationalities are\nstanding almost solid.\n\u201cThe one thing needed now to win\nthe strike is funds to keep the families\nof the strikers from starving until the\nmine owners give up.\u201d\nREALTY CO.

This means at least $40,000 a\nmonth, which will go far toward pay\ning the cost of the strike, which is\nestimated at $30,000 weekly.\nWilliam Davidson, executive board\nmember of the Western Federation,\nBritish Columbia, passed through Chi\ncago on his way to the copper coun\ntry, where he will take temporary\ncharge of the strike.

Monday. The work of\nstriking a jury was started as soon as\ncourt convened.\nIn the seats on one side of the court\nroom wore the veniremen, from whom\n12 will be chosen to decide the fate of*\nthe man on trial. All the other\nbenches in the room were closely\npacked with morbid spectators.\nThe vestibule and the hall on the\nfifth floor of the city halt were packed\nwith men and women who struggled\nto gain entrance.\nDeputy sheriffs were instructed by\nthe court to bar all persons after the\nseats had been filled, and many per\nsons who heard the instructions given\nwaited patiently from 10 a. m. so that\nthey might secure admittance.\nAfter the doors were closed many\nof those who were denied admittance\nwaited in the hallway during the aft\nernoon, occasionally peering through\nthe door in an effort to get a glimpse\nof the prisoner, who calmly sat beside\nhis attorney, John C. Kleist, appar\nently ignoring the whole proceedings.\nDeputies Fight Way.\nDeputy sheriffs who escorted the\naccused man to the court room had\nto fight-their way through the crowd\nin the hallway. Everybody pushed\nforward'in order to see the man who\nis said to have committed the heinous\ncrime.\nThe curiosjty of the spectators and\nveniremen who sat in the court room\nwas equally great, and all eyes were\nturned upon the short, stocky figure\nthat walked unhesitatingly to the\nfront of the room.\nThe crime of which Dorow is ac\ncused is one of the most brutal that\nwas ever recorded in the criminal an\nnals of Wisconsin.\nThe victim, Mrs. Emily Will, aged\n52, was a widow and lived alone in a\nsmall apartment in the rear of a gro\ncery at Thirty-first and Vliet streets.\nIt was her custom to go every Monday\nmorning to the home of Mrs. John\nKraus, 46 G Thirty-eighth street, a\nrelative.\nWhen she failed to appear at the\nKraus home Monday, Oct. 20, Mrs.\nKraus became alarmed and tele\nphoned to Police Lieut. John Maas,\nbrother of Mrs. Will. The lieutenant\nwent to the morgue and identified the\nbody by the clothes \u2014the face being\nsmashed beyond recognition.\nIs Struck Down.\nMrs. Will had been out for a walk\nthe night of Sunday, Oct. 19. and\nwhen she was returning home was at\ntacked by a man on Cherry street,\nbetween Thirty-fourth and Thirty\nfifth streets.\nJust what passed between the two\nis not known exactly, as Dorow has\ndenied the. story he first told. But\nit is certain that the woman was\nstruck down while walking on the\nstreet and then dragged into the alley.\nUe first said she refused to give him\nmoney when he approached her and\nthat he then struck her, not intending\nto kill her. The police, however,\nformed a different opinion, as th\nclothes had been partly torn from the\nbody.\nAttorney John Kleist a ohort time\nago induced the court to appoint a\ncommission to examine into the men\ntal condition of the prisoner. It was\ndone and he was pronounced sane.\nLater he denied that he had com\nmitted the crime and that he had\nmade a confession to the police.\n<S> <S> A <4> <s,\nTHE WEATHER.\nf ...\nFair tonight and probably <s>\nTuesday; rising temperature \u25a0s>\nTuesday and in west and central\n-\u2022 portions tonig\ngle of labor, come to their assistance with every\nmeans in your power.\nIn a letter to The Leader, Paul J.

ENGDAHL.\nCHICAGO, Jan. 13. \u2014Declaring that\nGov. Woodbridge N. Ferris, Michigan,\nhas the power to end the strike of\nthe copper miners, the Socialist party\nstrike investigating committee, con\nsisting of Victor L. Berger, Seymour\nStedman and Charles Edward Russell,\ntoday gave their conclusions as fol\nlows:\nFirst\u2014That the strike which has\ncaused such a loss of life and such\ngreat losses of money to the people of\nMichigan and the United States was\nentirely unnecessary and due wholly\nto the unreasonable and overbearing\nattitude of the mining companies.\nSecond \u2014That the employment of\nmilitia was entirely unnecessary,\nworked infinite harm and did no good,\nwhile the use of private guards to su\npersede, with their rifles and drunken\nwhims, the constituted authorities,\nhas been most clearly demonstrated\nto be a great, perilous and intolerable\nevil.\nGovernor Is Inactive.\n\u201cWe feel that we ought to add our\nconviction that ik was within the pow\ner of the governor of Michigan to end\nthis lamentable conflict, if he had\nearnestly sought to do so,\u201d declares\nthe committee.\n\u201cAt the time of our visit, nothing\nwas needed to secure the return of the\nmen to the mines, but the recognition\nof the miners\u2019 union. A demand so\nmoderate, so reasonable, and so\nmuch to the advantage of the com\nmunity, could hardly have been resist\ned if the governor had seen fit to add\nto it his approval.\n\"We profoundly regret that he did\nnot take advantage of so great an\nopportunity to serve his times, fur\nther the cause of justice and advance\nthe condition of the working class.\u201d\nThe committee spent several days\nin the strike zone, attended some of\nthe hearings held by Ferris, inter\nviewed nearly all of the strike officials\nand numerous strikers, visited many\nof trouble zones of the strike district\nand spoke by invitation at many of\nthe strikers' meetings.\nCongress to Get Report.\nTh? report was carefully consid\nered by the national executive com\nmittee in regular session here, after\nwhich it was approved in its entirety.\nA copy will be forwarded to congress.\nIt will also be sent to all Socialist and\nlabor papers for publication.\nIn speaking of the deportation of\nI\u2019resident Charles H. Moyer, Western\nFederation of Miners, the report says:\n\u201cThis a: .oundihg outbreak of the\nlynching spirit in Michigan is a foul\nblot upon the state. How far the\nCitizens' alliance is concerned with\nlav. ami order may be judged from the\nfact that for an outrage so monstrous\nand disgraceful it has ever expressed\nthe least concern, and many of its\nmembers, if they were not participants\nin the mob have since been quoted in\napproval ot the mob's vile work.\n\u201cAnd we can not avoid here the\nduty ot condemning in the strongest\narms the newspapers that have tried\nto excuse or palliate the mob\u2019s acts,\nand the correspondents and news\nagencies that sought in subtle and\nadroit ways to discredit Mr. Moyer\u2019s\nabsolutely terrific story.\n\"11 such agencies for the poisoning\nof news and the perverting of public\npinion are to go unrebuked, we may\nwell and seriously question whether\nwe do not live in a condition of prac\ntical anarchy, and whether any man\nthat advocates any cause distasteful\nto the powerful has any rights, or any\n\u2018 hence of protection under the laws.\nPress Perverted Facts.\n\u201cAn to the perversion of news, that,\n.\u2019rom the first, has attended this strike.\nWe have space to dwell here on only\nthe one subject of the reports of vio\nb nee by strikers. These have been\n3 tread broadcast over the country,\nnd have created in the public mind a\ntotally false idea of conditions.\n\u201cWe have investigated a great many\nof these allegations, and have found\nthat the actual manifestations of a\n\u2022 pirit ot violence among the strikers\nhave been very few and unimportant.\n\u201cOn one occasion, passengers at\n:< mining to board a train found them\n: elves pushed off the steps by armed\n; uards, and discovered that the car\nwas filled with strike breakers. Where\nupon a shower of stones broke ail the\nwindows on one side of the ear. A\nwoman beat a strike breaker in the\nface with a broom. Some strike\nbreakers have been hooted and jeered.\n\u201cThis constitutes about all the verit\nable assaults of violence on the part\nContinued on Page Two.\nThe Milwaukee Leader\nVOL. 3\u2014NO. 30.\nDEATH LURKS\nFDR POOR AS\nBITTER COLD\nCRIPS EAST\nthousands, Homeless, Hungry\nand Illy Clad, Swamp Charity\nSocieties With Pleas for Aid.\nGale Wrecks Property.\nNEW YORK, Jan. 13. \u2014The entire\neast was in the grip of its first cold\nwave of the winter today and was\nrocked by a gale which endangered all\nshipping and whipped through the\ncity streets wrecking buildings .and\nsigns and endangering pedestrians.\nThe blizzard caused the greatest\nsuffering among thousands of unfor\ntunates who called at municipal lodg\ning houses for aid or were entirely\nwithout shelter. The temperature\nstood at G above zero today, with the\nmercury steadily falling.\nRelief organizations here were\nswamped with pleas for aid. The mu\nnicipal lodging houses were crowded\nto overflowing and ambulances were\nkept busy during last night and early\ntoday answering calls.\nAlong the middle Atlantic coast\nfreezing temperatures were reported\nfrom all points today. In many places\ncold records were all but broken. Al\nbany, N. Y., reported 14 below zero,\nSyracuse reported 12 to 16 below and\nSaratoga 20 below. ,\nIce Harvesting\nTo Bring Relief\nSuffering has \u2018been intense among\nthousands of families because of the\nsevere cold snajj which struck Mil\nwaukee Sunday night. The charitable\norganizations have been working.over\ntime answering appeals for help by\nthose who have been unable to make\nproper preparations for the cold\nweather.\nTuesday morning the Associated\nCharities received 12 applications for\nhelp. The demands were for fuel,\nfood and clothing. An investigation\nwas made at once and their needs\nwere provided for.\nAt the Salvation army headquarters,\nJuneau avenue, between 25 and 30\nmen applied for help.

The Milwaukee workers know that the heroic\nfight of the miners is their fight; the miners\u2019 victory their victory.\nThe ready reply to The Leader\u2019s editorial appeal of yesterday proves\nthis beyond any question.\nMany bundles of clothing have already come in to the Social-\nDemocratic party headquarters, second floor, Brisbane hail. Many\npersons have called up by telephone to declare that they had cloth\ning which they wanted to give.\nTo make the collection more easy\u2014for many can not spare the\ntime to come to Brisbane hall from some distance with large bundles\n\u2022\u2014The Leader has arranged to collect the clothing by automobile.\nCall up Grand 5060 by telephone and give the operator who answers\nyoer name and address. Then do up the clothing you wish to give\nin a neat bundle so that it can be handled easily. The Leader auto\nwill do the rest.\nCollections will be made in the morning. If you notify The\nLeader late in the morning or in the afternoon the auto will be\naround the following morning.\nTelephone now. There is need of haste. For on the wind swept,\nsnow swept wastes of northern Michigan men, women and little chil\ndren are suffering with the cold. Let us rush a carload of clothing\nto them just as soon as we can.\nThe Leader wishes to emphasize the fact that you are the ones\nwho arc helping your fellow workers in their fight against capitalistic\noppression. The Leader is merely your agent. This is no self-ad\nvertising charity stunt such as local capitalist papers- conduct around\nChristmas time. It is the answer of workingmen and women, and\ntheir paper, to the appeal of other workingmen and \\Vomen for co\noperation in the world wide upward conflict of labor.

Secretary and Treasurer, j\nDated January 13,1914. *\nESTABLISHED 1856\nBE SURE OF YOUR FOOTING\nJohn Stoll Doost Vernon County and\n\u201cOld Wisconsin\u2019\u2019\nPasadena, California, January 2.\nFriend Munson: Just a few lines\nthrough the CENSOR, to my inquiring\nfriends: lam rot selling any real es\ntate, but have had a grand trip for the\npast ten days We went to Chicago in\nthe snow on the 23d of December. In\na short time were on the bare land again\nin Illinois. On the morning of the 24th\nwe had plenty of snow again, which\nlasted to nearly Sacr. ento City, Cali\nfornia, and plenty of it, and winter\nright. Part of the way was like real\nWisconsin winter weather. We spent\nChrisimas and the next day in Salt Lake\nCity looking over many things new to\nus. The temple square containing the\ntemples and tabernacle and its bureau\nof information, all of which we were\nglad to be shown. Also were in St.\nMary\u2019s cathedral and at many other\npoints of interest.\nWe landed at San Francisco on Sun\nday morning, leaving winter behind,\nwhere sunshine and rain have made\nplenty of green grass, which looks fine\nfor winter time. While in San Fran\ncisco I met Frank Onley, formerly of\nViola, who think* that part of Califor\nnia is the only country. Mr. Onley said\nit had been too dry since 1909, only\nwhere they could irrigate the land, and\nthe rain was what they wanted. Since\nleaving San Francisco I see they are\nhaving floods and washouts, trains laid\nup and many of the farmers in low lands\nwiped out of house and home in the val\nleys of upper California.\nWe spent two days in Frisco observ\ning what could be seen by tourists, (or\ncountry people as they call us) went\nthrough Chinatown, where they claim\nthirty thousand Chinamen,and of which\nplenty were small ones. We left for\nLob Angeles and Pasadena arriving on\nJanuary Ist, 1914, and from this far-olf\ncity we wish one and all at home a hap\npy and prosperous New Year. We\nwatched the grand parade of the rose\ntournament. There were some grand\nfloats, and many of them. The parade\nlasting over an hour, as we were in one\nplace all that time. In the afternoon\nwe were at the park where there were\nmany races\u2014chariot, hurdle and foot\nracing, high jumping, many things of\ninterest which made the first day of the\nyear a busy one for us. >\nIt is all right and fine at this time of\nthe year and we enjoy being here. The\nfreeze of 1913 was bad for the ranchers\nhere and I am of the opinion farming\nis not in its highest state. There is\nlots of wealth but I am of the strong\nopinion a great deal of it was made in\nthe east. At any rate, Viroqua and\nVernon county looks good to us, and\nnowhere have we seen any more pros-\nBerous country than old Wisconsin.\n(any who have been in the west for\nyears will hardly believe in the advance\nin the enst. but I for one can tell them\nof the modern farm homes, and that\nour farmers of today are on the top\nrow with the cash in their jeans, and\nthe best is none too good for them.\nUps and downs hit most of us some\ntime in life, no matter where we go.\nTb- whole thing in this life is in being\nsatisfied and contented, and this leads\nme to say: be sure you have something\n1 letter than Vernon county before you\nmake any change, as Wisconsin and\nVernon county are to me at the head of\nthe list. Mv wife says to me \u201cbe a\nbooster for Wisconsin.\u201d That is what\nthey do in Pasadena.\nYours, J. E. Stoll.\nRoger the Whole Works\nHon. Roger Williams of Hillsboro,\nwho, as justice, lias doubtless married\nmore couplea than any man in Vernon\ncounty, gives notice how to wed with\nout license er medical examination. In\nthe Sentry he advertises:\n\u201cTo all those who contemplate mar\nriage in future and wish to wed under a\nsolemn contract, which is binding and\nlawful under the laws of this state, I\nwill draw up for them. The common\nlaw prevails in this state. All that is\nnecessary to do for two people who wish\nto be married is to make b written\nstatement, before witnesses, that they\ntake each other as man and wife. You\ndon\u2019t require any license, medical ex\namination, priest, clergyman or magis\ntrate.\u201d\nDetermined to Hoist Head Officers\nModern Woodmen everywhere are\nsounding the slogan for defeat of pres\nent head officers of the society, who\nwere instrumental in attempting to\nforce the outrageous increase in rates.\nThe local camps will elect delegates at\nthe first meeting in February to attend\na county convention to be held in Viro\nqua later. Camps are entitled to ore\ndelegate for each 26 members. Every\nWoodman in the county should attend\nthe meeting cf his local camp at the\nfirJt February meeting and have a full\nrepresentation at the county convention.\nThe unhorsing of head officers can only\nbe accomplished by moral support and\ndetermination of members.\nChance for More State Inspectors\nIce cream dealers and traders in oys\nters ate now required tn conform with\nanew regulation by the weight and\nmeasures department of the state. Pa\nper ice cream and oyster containers\nmust be filled to a certain height and\nbe marked by a perforated line accom\npanied by the words\" Fill to the Mark.\u201d\nThe capacity of the paper bucket must\nalso be plainly indicated on tbe side or\ntop.\nImportant to Threshermen\nAnnual convention of the Wisconsin\nBrotherhood of Threshermen will be\nheld in Madison city January 20th and\n21st. Every tbresherman in the state,\nwhether a member of the association or\nnot, is welcome to attend this conven\ntion and the special attraction on the\nevening of the 20th in the shape of a\n\u201cDutch Lunch\u201d and smoker.
