Natural Language Processing Text Analysis in Python

Text Analysis, also known as Natural Language Processing or NLP, is a subdiscipline of the larger disciplines of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

AI and machine learning both use complex mathematical constructs called models to take data as an input and produce a desired output.

What distinguishes NLP from other types of machine learning is that text and human language is the main input for NLP tasks.
